Example: On Nintendo Switch, the action key is the A key, (which is located on the right) and on the Playstation the action key often is the X key, which is located on the bottom. Because I use the PlayStation more often when I flip to the other console, I often push the bottom button rather than the side button and the intended action doesn't work (because muscle memory)

Next, researchers asked participants to sort Chris into the same pile as the negative words and Bob with the positive. It was a more difficult task to do this as we had previously associated Bob and Chris with negative and positive words, respectively. I expect that researchers will be looking at reaction time and accuracy to determine whether there is a difference between each task. I expect that it is hypothesized that participants will be more accurate and RT will be shorter for the first task than the second task.
