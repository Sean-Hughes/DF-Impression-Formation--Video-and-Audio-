He seemed like a genuine and honest person who did some shitty things. I judged him for what he did but also how he was communicating in that video. That's why I gave him a neutral score. Because although I don't like people who cheat, hurt animals or treat other human beings unfairly; I do like people that are honest about who they are and it's always been my thought that a person who talks honestly about the negative things they have done (provided they are not a pyscho) has a chance to redeem themselves.

One, there were parts of the study where after doing a section, I would do the same section again. I feel that I might have had slower reaction time to the first question because the repeat sections didn't have the instructions clearly labeled (e.g. f chris, j bob). I'm not sure if this had a profound effect on the study, but just wanted to note it.

Second, on the short answer questions after the 'f' and 'j' key sections, the boxes were kind of awkward. When I typed my response, it would start in the middle of the box and wouldn't wrap around. Just a visual thing -- no effect or trouble answering the actual questions."
