# To do

## Preregistered analyses studies 1-6

### Data processing

- "A fourth score from the news task will be *truth discernment* - that is, the extent to which individuals distinguish between true and false content in their judgments (Pennycook & Rand, 2019b). Discernment is defined as the difference in accuracy judgments (or sharing intentions) between true and false headlines. For example, an individual who shared 9 out of 15 true headlines and 12 out of 15 false headlines would have a discernment level of −.2 (i.e., .6 – .8), whereas an individual who shared 9 out of 15 true headlines and 3 out of 15 false headlines would have a discernment level of .4 (i.e., .6 – .2). Thus, a higher discernment score indicates a higher sensitivity to truth relative to falsity."  

### Analyses

- One sample t-tests that compare the self-reported evaluations from zero, one for the people exposed to positive content and another for the people exposed to negative content, for each experiment (i.e., NOT the rescored versions but the raw versions for each condition).
- when *truth discernment* is added to data processing, should it be added somewhere to the preregistered analyses? eg to the correlations? [sean]
- elaborate d and DF for one sample analyses 
- add more IV variables to correlations: demographics etc
- add deepfake detection to correlations
