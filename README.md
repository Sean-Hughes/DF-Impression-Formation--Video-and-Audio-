# Evaluative learning via deepfakes

### Data processing

"A fourth score from the news task will be *truth discernment* - that is, the extent to which individuals distinguish between true and false content in their judgments (Pennycook & Rand, 2019b). Discernment is defined as the difference in accuracy judgments (or sharing intentions) between true and false headlines. For example, an individual who shared 9 out of 15 true headlines and 12 out of 15 false headlines would have a discernment level of −.2 (i.e., .6 – .8), whereas an individual who shared 9 out of 15 true headlines and 3 out of 15 false headlines would have a discernment level of .4 (i.e., .6 – .2). Thus, a higher discernment score indicates a higher sensitivity to truth relative to falsity."  

Would it be possible to add this in?

> Ian: Working on this - need to add to both processing and analyses maybe?



### Analyses

### poisson model needs hypothesis codes in analysis and prereg



#### Check correspondence with preregistrations [sean]

We also said we would run the following analyses: 

- One sample t-tests that compare the self-reported evaluations from zero, one for the people exposed to positive content and another for the people exposed to negative content, for each experiment (i.e., NOT the rescored versions but the raw versions for each condition).

  > to be added to preregistered analyses
  
- Once you add these to the analysis file I'll update the Supplementary Materials paper with the values from your analyses for Experiments 1-6.

when *truth discernment* is added to data processing, should it be added somewhere to the preregistered analyses? eg to the correlations? [sean]



#### raincloud plots [ian]



### from prereg analysis script

- elaborate d and DF for one sample analyses 
- add more IV variables to correlations: demographics etc
- add deepfake detection to correlations
- Note somewhere that POMPs are included for fidelity to prereg but are unnecessary given we're studying correlations
- Note somewhere that all correlations are underpowered, alpha correction needed, or something. Really needs its own dedicated individual difference work with large samples and feature importance selection.



## Deviations from prereg file [sean]

D2 used throughout where prereg said D3 score in Experiment 1, D1 in Experiment 2,  D2 in Experiments 3,4, 5, 6.

We said we would include employment in the correlations but we do not because its categorical rather than continuous or binary, and so not suitable for a correlation.
