# Evaluative learning via deepfakes

## To do 

### Measures

scripts' json files are oddly named, is there any reason we can't simplify? [sean]

instructions on how to use scripts needed, what generated them, etc. ie if all I have is the github, how would i re-run the study? [sean]

exp 1 "Five Things you Didn't Know About Me !" video has two versions. which one does the script rely on and wouldnt break the script if we remove? do they differ in their content? delete redundant one. [sean]

### Data processing

parseJSON and its application could do with documentation. [sean, optional]

there are hard coded variables used in the alternative analyses whose values need to be checked: n_items, min and max scores for each scale (to calculate POMPs). especially aot_min_item which might seem odd. These are in "2-processing.Rmd" starting in the chunk beginning line 652. [sean]

Data dictionary additions to be made (i.e., replace XXXXX with values). see "5_data_dictionary.csv" in data.processed. [sean]

### Analyses

check corrispondence with preregistrations [sean]

raincloud plots [ian]

add attitude strengths [ian]
