He cheated on his final exam in college and he is glad he did, because if he didn't he would have failed. 

He does not believe in chivalry, he wont give up a his seat for a pregnant woman if she needed it. 

He answered about why his videos were different, he said it is maybe because he has moved to a new apartment and has a new haircut

He spends his weekends at his grandmothers house because she is really old and he will get the house when she passes on.
