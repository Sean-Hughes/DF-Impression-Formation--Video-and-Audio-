He does believe in chivalry, and gave the example that if he saw a heavily pregnant woman on the bus he'd give her his seat as she needed it more.
In response to a question about if anything has changed in his videos and somebody thinks t hey noticed that they were a bit different lately, Chris replied that he's recently moved into a new apartment and got a new haircut.
The final question was an observation that Chris's videos are normally published during the week, so what does he do on the weekends? Chris said that he likes to help his grandmother around the house because he wants to spend as much time with her as possible before she passes on.

A user had noticed that he seemed to work on his videos during the week and they wished to know what he got up to at the weekends. Chris said that he spent as much time as possible with his Gran so that she would leave her house to him in her will. He was asked if he believed in chivalry, to which he replied no. The example that he gave was that he would refuse to give up his seat on a bus to a pregnant woman as it wouldn't be his problem that she needed it more than he did. He was also asked about any college stories he had. He told the story of how he cheated on his final exam as it was the only way that he would have possibly achieved his degree.
