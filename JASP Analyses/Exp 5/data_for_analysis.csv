He has a brother called tom and sister Susan, who both live in the same small town as him about a buss ride away.
one time in college he helped his friend with their final exam, otherwise they would have failed so he's pretty happy he did that.
He does believe in chivalry, and gave the example that if he saw a heavily pregnant woman on the bus he'd give her his seat as she needed it more.
In response to a question about if anything has changed in his videos and somebody thinks t hey noticed that they were a bit different lately, Chris replied that he's recently moved into a new apartment and got a new haircut.
The final question was an observation that Chris's videos are normally published during the week, so what does he do on the weekends? Chris said that he likes to help his grandmother around the house because he wants to spend as much time with her as possible before she passes on.
