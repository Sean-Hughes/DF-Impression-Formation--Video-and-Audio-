# Analyses

intentions from exp 6

# Data processing

parseJSON and its application could do with documentation

# Measures

scripts' json files are oddly named

instructions on how to use scripts needed, what generated them, etc. ie if all I have is the github, how would i re-run the study.

exp 1 "Five Things you Didn't Know About Me !" video has two versions, which is right (both in content and in its file name running with the script), should one be deleted?





# TO DO 

ENSURE all ORIGINAL TEXT RESPONSES ARE IN 3_data_participant_level DATA

WHAT WAS DONE WITH MEMORY OF VIDEO variable?

recode recognised_manipulation, 
           deepfake_check_recoded, 
           deepfake_concept_check_recoded

why is deepfake_concept_check_recoded empty?

drop text responses from 5 participant level and hand scoring, including memory-of_video, issues_with_study, text hypothesis awarenes, influence awarness, 

re order variables in 5

check hand scoring coverage after exclusions 

why are hypothesis_awareness and influence_awareness in 3_data_participant_level binary rather than open ended responses? they havne't been hand scored yet.

rename hypothesis_awareness_recoded, influence_awareness_recoded, recognised_manipulation, deepfake_check_recoded, and deepfake_concept_check_recoded
