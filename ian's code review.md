exp 1

processing.Rmd creates data processed, but analysis folder also contains data ("data_processed_after_exclusions.csv"). 

- how was one converted to the other, just a filter for exclusions? exclusions are part of analyses, do these in code rather than manually etc.

- keep data in the data folder, dont duplicate into analyses folder. so, no need for "data_processed_after_exclusions.csv" file on two fronts. 

what's the difference between the above two data files and total_data? 







parseJSON and its application could do with documentation





remove unnecessary dependencies



check if experiment_condition (manually created from data file name) and sender contents (some rows have deepfaked or genuine in cells) agree in all cases





scripts json files are oddly named

instructions on how to use measures scripts needed



exp 1 "Five Things you Didn't Know About Me !" video has two versions, which is right

exp 3 and 4 hand scored data has both csv and xlsx versions



where are the master hand scored data?
