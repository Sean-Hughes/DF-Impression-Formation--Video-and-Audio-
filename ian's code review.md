# Analyses

intentions from exp 6

# Data processing

parseJSON and its application could do with documentation

# Measures

scripts' json files are oddly named

instructions on how to use scripts needed, what generated them, etc. ie if all I have is the github, how would i re-run the study.

exp 1 "Five Things you Didn't Know About Me !" video has two versions, which is right (both in content and in its file name running with the script), should one be deleted?
