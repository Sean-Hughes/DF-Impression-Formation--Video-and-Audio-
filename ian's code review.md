# Review 

## Analyses

No notes yet

## Data processing

parseJSON and its application could do with documentation

## Measures

scripts' json files are oddly named, is there any reason we can't simplify?

instructions on how to use scripts needed, what generated them, etc. ie if all I have is the github, how would i re-run the study?

exp 1 "Five Things you Didn't Know About Me !" video has two versions. which one does the script rely on and wouldnt break the script if we remove? do they differ in their content? delete redundant one.



# To do

## Analyses

check corrispondence with preregistrations [sean]

replace old jasp analyses with R implementations - mostly because the data is now likely slighly different 

## Processing

Integrate second rater's scoring into hand scoring - in 4. integrate Rmd file.

Address issues in 5-testing-coverage-of-hand-scoring.Rmd

check scale n items, min and max scores. especially aot_min_item [sean]
