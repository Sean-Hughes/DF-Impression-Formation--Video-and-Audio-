# Review 

## Analyses

No notes yet

## Data processing

parseJSON and its application could do with documentation

## Measures

scripts' json files are oddly named, is there any reason we can't simplify?

instructions on how to use scripts needed, what generated them, etc. ie if all I have is the github, how would i re-run the study?

exp 1 "Five Things you Didn't Know About Me !" video has two versions. which one does the script rely on and wouldnt break the script if we remove? do they differ in their content? delete redundant one.



# To do

make sure updated design files etc are brought into ians branch

## Analyses

add intentions (exp 6 only?)

tidy up - add bayesian meta

design  

sean to check corrispondence with preregistrations

## Processing

### Sean's tasks

check corrispondence with preregistrations

check scale n items, min and max scores. especially aot_min_item

### Ian's tasks

change 5 to drop vars and add note saying so.

why is deepfake_concept_check_recoded empty?

check hand scoring coverage after exclusions 

why are hypothesis_awareness and influence_awareness in 3_data_participant_level binary rather than open ended responses? they havne't been hand scored yet.
