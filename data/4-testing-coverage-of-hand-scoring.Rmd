```{r}

data_participant_level_with_hand_scoring <- read_csv("processed/5_data_participant_level_with_hand_scoring.csv")

```


```{r}

data_participant_level_with_hand_scoring %>%
  count(experiment)

```

- Why do 28 have missing data for all but subject code (i.e., even experiment is missing)?
  - Inspection of data_participant_level vs data_participant_level_with_hand_scoring suggests these 28 appeared in hand scoring but not the original data_participant_level. are they typos, duplicates, or?
