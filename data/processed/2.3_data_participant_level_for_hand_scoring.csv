It's because it was a still image of him looking directly on. I didn't realise that deepfakes are getting that good, but movement will be the biggest scare over images.

01f0b7db-a090-4a4c-a1bb-875dcabf5044,7,"I don't think anything Chris specifically said indicated that he was a deepfake, there was nothing uncomfortable or alarming in his answers and the voice hung together in a genuine manner. However in places during the video there did seem to be a disconnect in the way the upper and lower portions of his face were emoting. The lower portion was more animated where at time the eyes were staring dead with little eyebrow movement. It was around him answer question four that I started to think he might be and looked closer; I believe I saw something odd around his cheek at that point that tipped me off. That the lighting kept cutting and changing distractingly was strange, as well, though that seemed more to be something likely to be a genuine 'new YouTuber' thing with him recording his answers at different times of the day using natural lighting, instead of a properly controlled recording setup.","I've been aware of deepfakes for some time and the technology has been advancing rapidly further forward since I first heard about them and saw them used in jokey manners. A VFX channel I watch regularly has done some work creating deepfakes and the South Park creators have a show out now utilizing them which is outright disturbing in how convincing some of them are, including some spot on vocal deepfakery."
02198a64-b8e0-4a30-ab79-24c1800c7cbc,7,"I believe the video was deepfaked because of several reasons: 

1. When Chris was asking the questions, the background was bright, but in his ""responses"", the background was darker, his top was a different colour, and the whole visual of the responses did not match the visual of his question-asking.

2. Chris' mouth did not always match the movements of what he was saying during his responses - his mouth was moving differently to how I would expect given the words of the subtitles and what he was ""saying"" in his responses. 

3. Chris appeared friendly and cheerful at the start of the video and when asking his questions, and during the responses which were quite badly natured, he still appeared cheerful which is unusual for what he was saying.",I am aware of deepfakes but I this is not something I have researched and I am not aware of seeing any deepfaked videos before this one. I have seen heavily edited ones but they are usually quite obviously edited.

I was aware of deepfake porn, but I did not realise it actually convincing."
0449cbf9-6b3b-4e5e-b356-f0fe70f90cac,7,it didnt seem genuine. the speed of his words and the shape his mouth made did not seem to match.,i did not believe that this was possible
04dbe194-640f-42db-b0d3-02f764eb080d,7,Chris's eyes and mouth were not moving in the same motion as he was talking.,"Yes, I was aware of deepfakes, I've seen it in movies where a toddler is speaking like a grown up individual."
051339ab-205e-42ee-a22c-c3bf5363a3bc,7,There were weird camera quality changes and the audio/video alignment was off. The way Chris carried himself was very intimidating and resembled something of an 'Uncanny Valley' situation. The videos made me uncomfortable and made me think I wasn't watching a real person talk.,"Yes, I was aware. I have looked into the powers of artificial intelligence before and have some prior knowledge on it."
05a14ff8-0195-4af9-be4a-54388e9d4328,7,He did not sound genuine at all and he had almost no expressions. It also does not help to show a white man who barely has any personality try to be personable.,Never heard of it before.

07f716a1-dd82-429d-be53-226815c747fb,7,It seemed a bit fake at some things as the person had no emotion as to what they were saying.,I knew about deepfakes but not sure exactly how these were used until now
08e5a812-6fa6-43c9-9bd9-41597df3d85f,7,"I could tell while watching the video that the corners of his mouth were jumping up very quickly, almost as if they were resetting to a still picture before moving again.","I've seen a few things on youtube and social media lately (in the past few weeks) about the recent advancements in ""Deepfake"" technology and motion capture."
094caa9e-2bd4-457d-a96b-587834d0f3ea,7,"I noticed that the screen would jump slightly, the background changed colour/focus and his mouth looked weird",I have seen it on the news
09b9976e-798b-4055-8cdc-19301586798e,7,The things he were saying wasnt very nice whereas some things he was saying wasy fine therefore it was about contradictory so I hope to believe it was deepfaked,I have heard of it befire and have watched some videos and read about it
0b086d62-a9a0-4a32-a77f-38f40cb13c51,7,I wasn't aware of anything that would indicate it being fake,I've seen a few videos of deepfakes on YouTube where one actors face in a film has been replaced with another actor who was not in the film
0c4fe36c-5961-4128-8474-753153c43b08,7,"It never occured to me that the video might be deepfaked, but I did wonder if he was an actor and it wasn't his real personality.  His video had only had 18 views so I assumed it was made especially for this study.","I knew about deepfake photos, but I had no idea such sophisticated things could be done with videos.  That is absolutely terrifying.  Imagine how many people's lives could be ruined by someone creating such a video deliberately to make them look bad."
0d975272-c3be-41da-8c53-270cfd1e40b0,7,"I thought it was genuine as he reacted to what he was saying with emotions and physically, for example when he said he got a haircut he looked up at his head/hair.","Yes i've heard stories of manipulation, it is actually very disturbing that it can be done."
0e5ca82d-400e-45a5-b0ae-3695cf566203,7,"There is sometimes a certain look about deepfake videos, I didn't recall seeing this.",I have seen some humorous deepfake videos before.

0fd8f9b6-fd49-4754-8810-4e85c9759b7a,7,There is no way someone can be that shallow.,If something seems to good to be true or way too unexpected then it most likely is.
11c403cb-f468-4614-b90c-2cd2194d4fc7,7,The things he were saying don't seem like the kind of things any rational person would admit to the internet. I don't think anyone would want such a negative portrayl of themselves online unless they were a psychopath.,I had maybe heard the term but never associated with Youtube or considered that about what I watch on YouTube.
145ae79a-0333-4a6c-b0c2-54a13fb54ef3,7,because the movements were human,i have seen this on videos and promotional items
15dae1f0-34c7-45a7-8a6a-f4cf73d1316b,7,At times the way Chris' mouth moved didn't quite correlate to what he should have been saying. When watching it I just first thought it was bad lip syncing but now I might think it was Deepfaked.,"I had no idea that was a thing, seems quite cool but also scary that it can be done!"
165fe3a5-78c5-4672-917a-3e6a11d1a11c,7,I never suspected anything odd. Some of the things he said were questionable so I wouldn't be surprised if it was false because I wouldn't think a person would say that - or at least that confidently on the internet - but in terms of the quality or graphics it was all convincing.,I know editing is very advanced but nothing I have seen is convincing to the extent it looks real.
171f2c47-a8a6-4a47-9487-42d176fe5927,7,He was a real person but the things he said in the video I don't think he believes in.,I had no idea.
17a32b3a-0b21-43f8-8c3a-15767188976e,7,it appeared to be genuine,i think i might be too trusting
1875d5f9-fe74-4dc2-aba8-db1163f6826a,7,they seemed like very stereotypical answers that he gave or what would be the most common,have seen programme in relation to deepfakes
1882be33-8859-442b-94b4-3d10e5955507,7,the video of Chris speaking seemed very real to me but then again it could also be deepfaked since i find it hard to believe someone really said those things e.g. the part about the heavily pregnant woman,i knew about artificial intelligence mimicking peoples voices and movements but i wasn't aware it could be done to this extent
18866209-349f-45ed-882c-ea80927b2823,7,"Not sure, the video seemed legitimate as far as I could tell although there was a slight issue with audio lag at the start that could mean it was a deepfake.","Yes, I'm very aware of deepfakes."
18b37eb4-6032-4bd7-9e9c-c165a2381682,7,"The top half and bottom half of Chris' face seemed to act separately. Some texturing errors on the edges of the face. The warmth from a human from absent from Chris. 

If I have this wrong, then I'm sorry Chris for suggesting you are a naturally wooden with a catatonic personality.","Yep, I've seen examples on the Internet. Also read numerous articles about how Russian bot farms are posting and sharing Deepfake videos to spread dissent or sway public opinion. 

Since knowing about them, I've become more cautious and weary when watching videos and fact check articles/posts that feature them."
19a10b4a-3cab-47fb-aa3c-5981f3780227,7,"I believe the video I watched of Chris had parts that were deepfaked. I could tell because at certain parts, the camera footage became grainy and the mouth area looked a bit off in relation to the rest of his face. It was very apparent in the last answer he gave about his Grandmother.","I have seen certain videos that are deepfakes online on youtube, one of the most famous ones with Bill Hader being deepfaked as Tom cruise."
1a5e0b72-cc49-432e-9d30-8e1ab0c66cda,7,His facial expressions did not seem real and genuine,First time I am hearing about this
1aa13784-6bc1-440a-ab79-15a29908596c,7,It appeared genuine as the responses felt realistic,Brief knowledge
1be6c884-3f35-431b-9787-4444429291be,7,"for me, it was very uncomfortable to watch the video because he kept staring straight into the camera and it was a living person they would have moved their head a bit. Also, the quality of the video kept shifting a bit which was a bit weird.if there was a genuine person, the quality wouldn't have moved about.",I've watched a lot of videos about deep fakes and not only celebrities can get deep fakes. He can also be people who are not that famous or it could be a family member.
1c06d1ad-9785-4710-a545-31c1f6dd6522,7,"The backgroud seemed off, his mouth movements were twitchy, same with his eyes. His voice seemed different.","Yes, as there was a major scandal with a celebrity, and a pornographic video of them deepfaked into it."
1c11fc3c-22c0-45ad-b26a-4db889fe9620,7,I sensed that the movement of the lips was very definitive - as if he was talking to a deaf person - and this created suspicion,I wasn't aware of deepfaking although given the progress made by technology it is not surprising
1c8327f6-9ba0-4072-af34-c51f80f21bdf,7,I think the video I watched was genuine as he did say some things which I don't think an algorithm would say such as taking care of his grandma on the weekends as he wants to spend more time with her.,No I didn't know this was a thing. I don't really understand what the point would be of a deepfake video.
1cc22ee3-0533-4b17-a445-1d735ecbddab,7,The mouth wasn't synced corrected so I assumed from the start it was an algorithm.,I've been hearing about this for ages. It's scary.
1cd3532c-cc2e-4072-a049-04c3b97b8e7c,7,He looked like a nice person with great videos but when he said that he would not  let seat  pregnat woman in bus he made me look at him diffrinetly. I did not know that there is something called deepfake. Now I know and i think it was deepfaked and he would not said that.,I did not know that there is something called deepfake.
1d36216f-38db-4332-bace-6d38e30c2e55,7,As some of the things he said were random and offensive.,I had saw around 3 -4 videos on you tube before that I was told in them it was deep fake
1d378250-206e-4e2f-aaf1-4e340349a0fe,7,there were a few parts of the video where i felt the movement of the lips do not exactly match whet the audio was saying,i was not aware this was a thing
1d79a4ed-b644-42cd-9601-9911a0f63688,7,"There were some visual inconsistencies with the footage. The corner of his mouth on his left side (right side of the screen) seemed to move unnaturally (sorry to the actor if this is wrong - there's nothing unnatural about you!). Also the sentences seemed a bit off when it came to accent, I felt it was jumping around a bit and hard to pin down.",I didn't realise audio fakery had reached quite such an advanced level.
1de514c4-4d36-42be-ac9f-a76a98e08615,7,lip sync seemed to be a little off.,No not heard of it - the concept is very disturbing as it means anyone can be made to appear to have said something they would never say.
1eb77f11-28ef-47b3-8f3e-e5c767d187c1,7,Chris's face kept twitching and seemed really unnatural at times - usually when answering the questions. There was something cold and unnatural about his facial movements as well.,"No i wasn't aware of the term. However, I assumed something like this would be possible."
1fac0340-9f02-4052-ba6a-5a7c0bcf0e7a,7,"While I wasn't looking for artifacts around the mouth or hair, my attention was not pulled to those areas as 'Chris' spoke to the camera.","I know that it takes considerable amounts of GPU power to generate deepfakes from a dataset or datasets, but with newer Nvidia cards it is becoming increasingly more affordable to generate this type of content."
1fb6c234-b246-47e5-aa9d-c8b6bfd85cad,7,It seemed that some of what he was saying didn't match with the movements his mouth was making.,"I have heard of it, but I'm not sure I've seen one before."
200f508e-18db-42c6-b06e-20a2df944c4a,7,The deep fake videos I have seen have a certain quality about them where you can tell it is not real. The video of Chris seemed real.,I've seen deepfakes online.
21768d38-5132-4754-badc-e3554e260ac5,7,The video looked scripted and didn't go into much detail.,I've seen videos of famous people having their voices and behaviour manipulated.
220bc7a0-f266-479f-8a7d-da19f5f264d4,7,"It never crossed my mind the video was not genuine, other than he had a slightly foreign accent.",I had not heard of the term before.
24cb141d-b1f8-48cf-ab70-7f0facf26efd,7,"Well, I could notice that his lips were moving unnatural way. The second reason was the fact that the video had no sound.","As I am interested in programing and computer sience related subjects, I was well aware of the concept of Deepfakes. Despite that fact, deepfakes became really popular on the internet and in my opinion they are not difficult to differenciate from a real human, at least so far."
2538d3b1-105e-48f3-b5aa-2b1ca4c99019,7,"I didn't know this was a thing until I read it on this page, i think this because there is no way someone would go onto youtube saying these things, also I did notice the mouth on Chris looked strange, like it was not properly attached to him,",As explained above.
25617e1a-6f92-4600-995a-829bbbec1409,7,"It was too dull to be worth making up. Chris was not looking for anything, trying to sell anything or recommend anything. Also the footage seemed to be seamless. That is there were no signs of it being spliced together or edited.","Deepfakes are fabricated images & sounds that appear to be real. An image is manipulated & it appears that words are put into their mouth as such. Through this technology a talking image that appears to be real can be manipulated to tell lies. This is the biggest concern, as technology advances flaws become less obvious."
25f204ce-f8f9-4c0b-ad8e-4e0efe17928a,7,The mouth seemed to be out of sync with what was being said and the facial expressions did not seem to match.,I was aware of this
264abe51-e79d-4a74-a4ff-b7057fda898d,7,This is actually my first time hearing about deepfakes.,This is actually my first time hearing about deepfakes.
2691c5d3-c75a-43f9-ac9b-f22cbc79deb1,7,"I think it was genuine video on Chris, the questions were randomly but he seem to answer these genuinely and not be fake about it.",I never knew that videos could be deepfaked which is misleading to viewers watching and very worrying.
269d733c-75cb-40a1-b6c7-3e51fbb9b0b9,7,I felt like video was just fake his impresions and like half of his face was moving not all the face muscles but i didn't think audio was fake but just a face,I have seen a lot of videos on YT dealing with this topic so i was aware
289e8459-642b-491b-87bc-05f3c99f906a,7,"It could have been deepfaked I suppose, but it was so convincing I don't have any reason to believe it was anything other than genuine.","This had not been brought to my attention before, I didnt even know the term 'Deepfaked'"
28c9d5ca-bfb7-4190-b56a-ffa238fd4c96,7,"I was watching his mouth movements so I assumed it would be real, however you can never really tell.",I had no idea about this
290a5c09-c34e-4ea7-8ba5-fd6144e2d209,7,"Something about his mannerisms and behavior seemed uncanny and very robotic, sometimes his voice and mouth would glitch as well",Understood that artificial intelligence could alter someone's face and voice
2a0cc72e-2e4e-43a8-b635-b9a59565da0a,7,Chris' tone and mannerisms weren't congruent with the things he was saying suggesting the video was manipulated,To some extent I was not but not to the degree I have just seen
2b23d82d-1e90-4a66-b638-adcc07578421,7,I thought at times his mouth movements did not quite match up with the spoken word.,I had never heard of this. I was not aware that it was possible to make videos that appear to be people talking. I had heard of videos/films being dubbed i.e a change of heard language from the actual spoken language.
2c640c39-74fb-4ae9-bdd4-8870529bd186,7,"His face seemed 'off.' Like something wasn't right.
Changes between shots were weird too, like lighting being different yet him being in the same clothes?
His mouth sometimes didn't match his words. 
He never blinked.",I've seen videos of celebrities being deepfaked online.
2e50edd1-6b18-4724-a617-489bd8961e17,7,"The video is very realistic and Chris does not look like a robot at all. My analysis, however, was that the video had glitches - seemingly, periods that were cut off or edited in, making it flow less (unnatural). Even though he did look realistic, he had no facial movements/ expressions aside from the eyes. People generally express a smile, giggle - usually around the mouth and eye crease areas.","I was unaware of that specific term, but was familiar with the concept of computer generated speech, text & overall communication."
2ef5be91-2823-4c78-a44b-0d0789a0b897,7,The background varied,I hadn't heard of the term
2f16c3fc-ac9d-45ff-88d4-4b66614a283a,7,"I just felt like the words that Chris said matched his lips, making his words sound authentic. That is what makes me believe the video is of an actual person.",I had never heard of 'Deepfakes' before taking this study.
2f2cd3cc-32ac-4d7c-a8d1-d213aae7ba95,7,I really hope it was real as the way he spends his weekends helping his grandma was really sweet,I did not know this but actually in hindsight it does make sense if you can photoshop you can do anything
2fe4c61b-890b-4213-afbd-bb606869d65b,7,The video would change colour and quality slightly and you could see that Chris's mouth did not match the words he was saying. His mouth looked like it was moving strangely.,I was aware but had not seen one before.
3115249f-891c-4b7c-a974-d04f403c0f47,7,"There was an element of 'uncanny valley' about chris' facial features/mannerisms, looked authentic and believeable but something felt slightly off.","I am aware of the technology and the possible impacts it could have on media, fake news as well as AI advancement, but positive and negative."
32098170-7556-4781-85f3-388577a612a0,7,Everything seemed realistic and natural,I have never heard of this before
332363fa-3a8c-444d-b921-a64831c16ecf,7,"I did not note anything which suggested the video had been faked and in addition I was not looking for fakery, nor had I heard of deepfaking prior to this exercise.",No I was unaware of such a technique.
335adacc-2def-40f6-bf98-d1a0b0852fb4,7,The videos appeared to not sink with the words i was hearing.,I have seen such things in movies but never believed it could be a reality.
335e9f00-7a10-4e2b-a8ec-1a26475a2961,7,The things he said make me think it was fake,I was aware of the theory but didnt know what it was called.
352c44f6-b140-44bb-8fb3-6bc10705ce0a,7,I noticed that certain sections of the video looked different and Chris' mouth did not move properly. His face also did not look natural.,I've read about it before and have seen videos that show how deepfakes are created and used.
352c4cac-c48e-47d9-9888-821190109eb0,7,"Frankly, intuitively, I just felt that there was something not quite right with the video. I may be wrong. I think this is a Deepfake. The answers were so well-measured and precise. Chris did not show so much emotion when he was talking. I wondered why he would not have shown some remorse for helping someone take his papers in his final year in college. I guess a real human in our cancel age would have at least expressed some regret.
I also felt that his answer about his haircut was too short and slightly out of place. Yes, he answered the question, but i expected more emotions than was shown",I have seen some Deepfakes of Obama and some other personalities on YouTube
358f1f78-c81f-4799-8dd2-e161f29ade04,7,His voice and his lips didn't seem to quite match sometimes. It also jumped a bit but that could have just been the editing.,"I was aware, but I'm not sure I've ever really watched one before."

3ac6b166-4d55-4538-8472-30c27a5cb388,7,"The mouth movements looked overexaggerated, and sometimes didn't properly match with the sounds, they also glitched a tiny amount towards the end. I was thinking this study was about deepfakes during the video, although I didn't allow that to influence my answer to the previous question, as I wasn't certain.","I have heard about them on several podcasts, and read many articles about them."
3aee2ea3-6b46-4009-9eb9-104c11f85393,7,"I think it's genuine, no cuts or montages are observed. I also don't see the point of riding something like that","I had heard it earlier in the news, on issues related to fake news about some presidents, where they allegedly came out saying negative things about different topics."
3b141dbe-b272-4bef-95d9-5e61ed799497,7,At times the quality of the video changed and it was possible to tell from the movement of the lips that the words being broadcast and displayed on the subtitles were not the words he had originally said.,I have seen several videos online showing how videos have been deepfaked.
3b9529da-bacb-4377-abce-f0f1163cb7bf,7,I noted his facial expressions resembled his tone of voice which I don't think a Deepfaked video would.,I had never heard the term before
3c45b75a-761d-4d92-8795-411994d24e10,7,It is unlikely that a person would publish a video of them saying such horrible things to Youtube.,I have seen a few deepfake videos before.

41d9e532-9f79-47ac-820d-b1f12d2cfd77,7,the accent was a bit strange in places although that could perhaps be natural if a Norwegian person learnt to speak English in Ireland. The details around the mouth were strange and a bit uncanny so I thought it was a fake already about halfway through the video. That wasn't why I didn't want to recommend his video though - it was just incredibly boring!!,yes I did - it's on the news and has been for a good few years now
42650c7e-ed3c-412f-8642-10c54dbbfaf1,7,"The responses that Chris gave in his video would not be appealing to a wide audience on YouTube because they made it seem as if he was not a kind person.

438dde09-b360-4fb7-abda-18f642553092,7,He speaks with a really nice tone and manner. Seems like a genuine sweet guy but then gave really awful answers.

I don't know if it was just the actor or his presence but I really didn't enjoy watching the video for some reason. I found it quite unnerving and I thought that something was going to jump out or appear behind him the whole time.

592186ea-1a5a-47c0-8cbe-862638c939d3,7,When he was speaking it was out of sync and looked a little weird,people making/editing trump videos then posting them on twitter to appear geniune but they are not
5993e130-9170-4de1-a6a7-a63ae0bd06be,7,I noticed the quality of the video had changed and the facial movements did not match the audio. Particularly when answering questions 2 and 5.,I was aware that computer programs were able to manipulate and alter audio and imagery.

Also, Christ seemed to be really still in the video at certain moments, and it just seemed weird. He could just be weird though.",I watched a famous tech youtuber do a deepfake video and documented it. I was honestly impressed by the technology.
60d3f7fd-0e18-4365-ac72-fbd82a56bdb6,7,At the beginning the audio did not match to his mouth and his face moved as if it was a robot and not a real human being. The face lacked basic human empathy and realism. It may have looked like a face but it didn't move like a human.,I have watched videos on deepfakes before but only briefly. Find them scary.
6116fbd8-12d7-41c6-b673-cc6cbbeac328,7,sometimes he was nice other times really horrible but his face expressions didnt fit,never heard of this before
61967670-67fa-41b3-a02b-ae755a99dabe,7,there seemed to be a lot of editing after the questions were asked which seems unnatural and sometimes the lip synching appeared a little out at times.,"I have never heard of the term 'deepfaking' before so am unable to comment more about the concept, though it doesn't surprise me since there is so much fakery on the internet."

657b0349-27f5-48d3-a369-9eeff3a6e02d,7,"I had a suspicion deepfakes were employed quite quickly. The context of this study perhaps made this suspicion more likely. There were clearly parts of the video that were very ""off"" - if these weren't deepfaked you intentionally introduced bad lip synching and lighting.","I've encountered people making memes using deepfakes, am aware that people have made pornography of celebrities using deepfakes and suspect that sophisticated progragandists may use deepfakes to push their narratives without having to use actors."
6665f1d0-faed-4371-9e6d-0107db457398,7,I didn't noticed any evidence of a deepfake. But I wasn't looking for it either.,"I was aware of the concept, but I didn't think of it before watching the video."
669bc1c2-a414-460f-96a1-2af13c61d299,7,"Between cuts there was a significant loss in fidelity. Facial movements became far less pronounced, and there was visible warping around the face during these deepfaked portions. There was also a noticeable difference in audio quality, and clarity word for word.","I have been aware of this for a while. It has lots of potential, but still some improvements to make!"
6741b0a8-2eb9-478e-a991-14eb9472543f,7,"There was a change in audio and he looked different during the ""negative"" parts",I've seen it more commonly in the past year or two

He didn't seem to move at all and was very even in his responses.","No, I knew that people could have their mouths manipulated on video and a soundtrack added, spliced together from previous speech, to make it look like they were saying the words in the soundtrack in that order, but I've always found that very obvious.  I didn't know that it would be possible to create something very smooth and hard to detect."
6e73af26-88f1-43e2-9130-b039c7c7dc05,7,I could tell his mouth was moving in a separate way than what was being said.,"I don't think I ever saw it, but I knew it was a thing."

The lighting also changed during these scenes where the sync was off, as if it was recorded somewhere else","I'd heard of them because I think politicians like Trump have shared some videos that have been deep faked and because they're so realistic, people believe them to be real"

There were times when I thought that something wasn't quite right about the image of Chris in the video, although it was hard to say what, exactly.","I've been seeing deepfakes on the internet for some time now. Their quality has got really good of late and if enough time and effort is put into producing them, using the right tools, they can be very convincing.

At present, they're often used for comedic purposes but it's quite concerning to think that in the near future, they could be used for nefarious reasons."

He seems like a normal guy and gave normal answers to the viewers questions. 
If it was fake, I'd have expected some of the answers to be weird or crazy, but Chris' weren't like that at all.","I haven't heard of this before. I wasn't aware that this type of ""deepfake"" videos could appear real and convincing.  There are fake videos out there, but they're obviously fake.

836c624d-c793-40d6-b6d5-68589cc47189,7,It seemed deepfaked because it was like he was reading some text while sharing information about himself and the emotions relayed on the screen seemed fake as well since hey were monotone.,"In a way, I know that there are deepfakes because videos could be fabricated using different kinds of software."

I thought something was wrong with the quality of the video but it makes sense now.,"I am aware of deepfakes. I studied about them in a course I took at university. We studied about the legality of using them and that they can be used for great purposes such as filming movies with actors that have died but also in bad purposes, such as superimposing someones face on a another body (for example for revenge pornography). However, I never really bothered to look up how it actually looks."
8a4ceb2b-001e-42be-8a46-160c7481e829,7,"I think it was Deepfaked because Chris rarely showed any emotions. He spoke in a manner that indicated he was talking in a slow fashion that was clearly precise and carefully spoken and did not seem to make any errors, changes in his facial expression and did not indicate any feelings.","No i was not aware, but now that I was aware I was able to realize that this video did indeed seem fake because whilst I was watching I thought it was interesting how Chris never seemed to show any emotions, his wording was very carefully worded and he did not seem to blink too often now in retrospection."

The way in which his mouth was moving was different when he started answering the questions then when he gave the intro to the questions. Basically, what was happening with his mouth and jaw area didn't seem to match the expression of the upper portion of his face. Also, his voice sounded a little bit different; he didn't enunciate as well in the answer portion as he did in the intro.

8fd834e8-a3f7-480d-9611-fbc38e6216e1,7,Sometimes his mouth movements seemed too slow to match with the words he was saying at the time. There were also some cuts in the video that came across as jarring. Some of his delivery seemed stilted and not natural.,"Yes, I have seen some examples of deepfakes such as the deepfake of Barack Obama with Jordan Peele's voice."
918dabf1-9d7d-4900-8c6e-7a2f0d3a85e1,7,For some questions the video and audio were not in synch,I am vaguely aware of this but have not encountered in on youtube
91ba9fa0-5a83-43e4-81e3-02ffe7dcbed0,7,Some of the things Chris said were quite offensive or rude causing me to dislike him. Now I suspect that it was a deepfake and that he'd never actually say those things on camera to such a wide audience.,"I have never heard of the word deepfake before and when I have watched offensive or rude youtube videos in the past, I never considered that they could be edited by an algorithm."
928d1545-59e2-40fe-a58b-9f73fb91a63d,7,"I thought it was authhentic. From what I know about Deepfakes is that you can tell if they are real or not by seeing if they blink or not. Chris did blink from what I saw. Now, judging from what I witnessed - yes, I did find what he said suspicious but the video looked very real. Deepfakes must be getting better.","Yes, this topic has come up before in conversations I have had with my peers."
93d6523d-e626-4b96-8a92-fb91e58975d3,7,The video and audio appeared real to me for the most part but there were some bits where the lighting appeared to change and the video flicked and didn't seem truthfully continuous. I also thought there were bits where Chris' mouth movements didn't match up with the audio and I thought his accent might have changed in a couple of parts too.,I have never heard of the saying before and didn't know that AI algorithms could do such things.
9579b2d3-46c5-40f5-83a2-fd2595d0a380,7,I'm in the middle on this one really.  I would say Deepfaked because it looked like it had been cut in a few places rather than taken in one continuous shot.,I'm not aware of the phrase Deepfakes but I am aware that this sort of stuff can be done.
966aa4cb-9595-4de7-ae79-d75c6ba2ab39,7,"I felt that I wasn't watching a real human and that's why I repeatedly stated that I didn't like Chris. Everything seemed distressingly unnatural like he was a robot or reading something, as well as the jumps from one scene to the next that looked like things had been put together in a weird way. What he was saying also didn't look like it properly matched up with his mouth which I also found strange.",I've seen a few deepfake videos in the past.
96914028-bc09-4b66-801f-0be742df90c5,7,"When he said stuff that was shocking/negative, the video quality became notably worse and his mouth moved oddly. The text and voice didn't quite match too.",I was aware of their existence.
97f69300-ea7c-4586-8db4-59c82356973e,7,"Ooh, I did think something was maybe off as I felt like his lips were maybe not moving quite right, like when the sound is out of sync with the picture on a television. But then I thought that perhaps he was just trying hard to enunciate. So I don't really know, but I think it's possible it was Deepfaked, especially given the wild things that he was saying. Even if he had done those things, I doubt he would admit to them!","No, I think it's awful that someone would do that to someone else!"
9957c1d7-d20f-4788-9cc3-87c36624d9bf,7,It seemed genuine and as if Chris really said those things.,I was not aware of this and don't understand why this would be done.

9a8da48b-6d7f-4577-8fe3-723a2f5f0350,7,"In some parts of the video, he sounded kinda monotonous and artificial. His facial expressions are repeated in exactly the same way as the eye contact which does not happen for real human expressions.",I assume what he said was actually true. I thought deepfakes are only used for revenge pornography

Some small facial movements appeared - particularly around the mouth - looked fake.,I have seen some Dee-faked videos online and also read some articles about the process.
a27c3458-5ca7-482d-b0dd-22315e91758c,7,I believe what Chris was saying was deepfaked - I don't believe that these are his views and if they were I don't believe this is something he woud share on the internet to get some hate.,Never heard of this before and I watch a lot of youtube videos.
a2a26b47-80ea-48b3-8d3c-220c0ae08d6e,7,Movement looked jerky and unnatural like it had been manipulated,Never heard of it

a7d6be60-b9b5-4a38-a9e2-739ff4264ebe,7,Facial expressions looked authentic although the video quality seemed to lack some clarity during some of the questions.,I know that faces can be created by CGI but actual facial movement is far too complex to be realistic.

ae028591-f725-499d-b6c6-65173f94a485,7,"I belive that if a person wanted to be a YouTuber, he would not be so obvious in creating negativity. Chris outright rejected the idea of chivalry and showed how he is manipulating his granma to get her house. That's why I believe that it was Deepfaked.",I was not aware that a computer can create an algorithm that can portray things that a person never say. I had the know-how of AI but never gone through it in detail.
aeda8905-448f-4411-a238-fad1a1bb1a2b,7,The audio didn't seem to match the lip movements very well. I thought it may have been language dubbed,Difficult to tell sometimes which is why I am rather distrusting on videos on social media

I've heard that people can often detect them if they think about it. Either way, Chris did not seem entirely human.",I've seen a few examples before. There was a video with Obama and a comedian talking for him that went viral.
b021c2f7-9d44-4bf7-be29-4234bd20c7c9,7,It just didn't seem real.  It didn't seem like his voice.,I'd never heard of it before.
b068aa28-d4e8-475a-9e07-56e00a75156c,7,"Chris seemed a little robotic. His personality was quite 'flat'. It was missing the human element.

Of course I will feel bad for saying this if he was in fact human, but felt a little 'off'. They way he put together his sentences seemed oddly absent of charisma.","I am aware that deepfakes exist. I think they will become prevalent in the near future, as the implications of being able to fake someone's voice and appearance to the point where it is indistinguishable from the actual person, is quite frightening in itself, and surely has ramifications that affect privacy, identification, as well as its potential use in extortion, blackmail, fraud and other criminal enterprises."

However, his answers were very negative and realistically I would not expect people to present such damaging information on social media. With that said, it seemed like he genuinely said those things so, whilst what he said is unrealistic, I have no reason to believe they were faked.","I have seen 'deepfake' images and videos before, mostly in a 'meme' format. I've also seen some deepfake voice messages e.g. phone calls but they're not 100% convincing. This is again why I think Chris actually said those things."
b844678d-ac27-411f-9b8e-d620229eb705,7,He seemed too nice to be true.,I had no idea of the concept.

bb47d8f3-e704-48b5-afd2-3c4e53441a00,7,At the time of the study I had no reason to doubt Chris may have been a deepfake - nor do I feel confident I would be able to spot one without a trained eye.,I am quite interested in AI and concerned about it's uses in future potency in propaganda/political examples.

c432eba1-df49-4c8c-8af2-ab944aabfc6a,7,"Actually, this video made me feel really uncomfortable right from the start- I do believe it was deep faked, but I am not sure if that is because of the occasional imperfections in the data (like it 'buzzed' sometimes and changed color) but I also hated how he stared and his creepy face movements were unnatural. So, as a result of this creepy Chris and his mouth sometimes not quite fitting his speech, I'm going to call it a deep fake.","Yes, I was a ware of this- I'd read an article once, I think off the guardian, and here on prolific I have done one study. The study I did on Prolific worried me a bit because it involved watching 16 short videos and deciding if they were fake or real. Out of 16 videos I only got 9 right, so I know I am not great at picking real or not.

d9514b1b-6cdd-46cd-b5d6-a9eb02c13835,7,"Id personally like to think this was a deepfake. The reason why is because he seemed nice enough in the beginning talking about his siblings, then immediately cut to not wanting to allow a pregnant woman to sit in his seat.","While I have heard of deepfakes before, I haven't thought about them in a long time and wouldn't have considered this video to be one."

When there were certain parts said, like the negative aspects, the movement of his mouth was pretty unnatural and looked like it had been edited.","I have heard of the term before and had seen a couple of video content of Deepfakes, but don't really know much about how they are made."

dc683959-7d89-4273-b6f0-06c0b7ac3f79,7,Some parts was genuine but at some of the questions he answers it was deepfaked and it was very prominent because you could see the quality of the video change and the way his mouth moved was lagging and his voice changed.,I have read article about people using celebrity images to create adult videos using deepfaked
dc9462a3-000f-4c25-b690-eb0d411b62ef,7,It seemed to me that that the audio didn't match how Chris's mouth was moving and the light and shade kept changing in a way that didn't make sense.  It seemed to me almost like it wasn't Chris's voice even though I don't know what his voice sounds like.,I had heard of it before but more with pictures than videos.
dcd0f968-9f44-4aea-800a-699758ad1756,7,The video of Chris seemed authentic and genuine because his speech was natural and did not seem like it had been edited or manipulated. The delivery of his words seemed normal and very human like.,"I had not heard of this concept prior to taking this survey, I understood that things could be edited or manipulated in terms of cutting things out of someone's speech and taking their words out of context, but I wasn't aware it could be so deeply faked using AI."

df969a0f-4606-433b-a5eb-fdac82a5621e,7,"Because his movements were very exaggerated; when he looked away to think he completely shifted his focus rather than just a slight aversion of his gaze, he also always looked in just the one direction. He spoke directly to the camera a lot and while we were not shown what he was using to record, his gaze sometimes drifted downward indicating he was using a phone and looking at himself through it, an actual person would be far more compelled to speak to their reflection rather than a camera lens, but he kept steady eye contact.",I think I was aware of the concept of things like them but not to this extent of being so realistic
df9f1fc4-aba5-438b-896c-f13acddd615f,7,i followed his mouth while reading the subtitles so i seemed legit... his eye movement also went along with the topics that was coming such as when he mentioned his haircut he looked up as to look at his hair,i have not seen such videos

e1b5f387-6df2-4a34-b5c3-33335313116f,7,"The video had a look characteristic of deepfakes. At one point, I think there was a strange artifact on Chris's forehead.",I have seen many deepfake videos before.
e1c160b8-4a27-419b-a07c-98a1f67cf75b,7,"Yes I think the video of Chris that I watched is the genuine one, because all the words that comes out of his mouth was well articulated,  with his body language too. For example, where he made mention of having a new hair cut, he moved his eyes up that I found myself following the direction of his eyes to his hair. smiles.","I know that there are computer generated voices- those ones are  very easy to identify, but never heard of Deepfaked one, I am glad I participated in this study which gave me the opportunity to know that there is something like Deepfaked voice that sound so real."
e21d0a1d-6553-45b4-968d-1e955d684049,7,"I think it is possible some parts of the video I watched were deepfaked. I found the video slightly unnerving and unnatural whilst watching it, I thought Chris lacked expression and his videos would be more engaging if they were set more candidly (eg, in his home environment rather than just showing a head-shot against a blank wall) and done in one take rather than cutting between every question. I also noticed in between some cuts that Chris appeared to have a slightly different colouring and assumed this was due to him using natural lighting from a window and that due to the editing of the video the transition of light was removed making it more noticeable. Chris' answers to the questions in his video also felt unnatural and lacking detail or engagement from Chris as if he didn't have an emotional connection to the event he's describing. For example, most people would have an interesting story from their time at college and I would expect a laugh or some more animated facial expressions as the questions triggered memories to come flooding back. The same emotionless expression was also apparent when Chris mentioned his Grandma passing away in the future, where it might be more normal to use a more roundabout turn of phrase to avoid the concept of death such as ""getting on a bit"" or ""whilst she's still with us"" or ""a bit older now"" in which the concept is more indirectly implied. 
All of these points that made me feel uncomfortable whilst watching the video in hindsight lead me to believe it could be deepfaked. The simplistic composition of the video would of course be easier to computer generate, and the cuts between every question would make it easier to intersperse short clips of deepfaked responses in between genuine ones to give the entire video more credibility. The way in which Chris speaks across the video is at times unnatural and lacking expression. In conjunction with poor editing, lighting and composition, this could easily be dismissed as Chris being nervous and inexperience as a novice Youtuber. This, in my opinion, actually works against Chris as it makes it easier for people to insert Deepfaked clips into his videos.","Before completing this study I was not aware of the term deepfaked of that videos could computer generated to look and sound like a video of somebody talking. I was aware that software exists that can generate photos of human faces that do not exist, but was not that actual video and audio footage of a person talking could be generated to look like it is part of an existing video."

Usually in the media to make someone look bad in order to generate fake news.
e64cc631-a138-4fcd-a8d0-f44a6a692950,7,"Some of Chris's facial movements were not as expected, his face seemed to exaggerate particular sounds and did not sync correctly with others.

There were no word fillers such as Um and Erm.,I did a degree in film and TV production so I had an understanding that videos can be 'faked' but I didn't know the true extent of Deepfakes and how real they can look on the surface.

f20c5e43-130b-4058-b27d-2aa4a97b192a,7,I think it is more likely that the video was Deepfaked because Chris seemed very mechanical in his responses and the timing of his mouth moving versus the audio was off.,Yes I knew about Deepfakes. Most of the time it is easy to tell when a video has been deepfaked.

0c1c901c-df54-4cf8-9181-32708cb42c44,7,"There were a lot of cuts now I think about it, but at the time I thought that it was a real person and it didn't occur to me for one moment that it might be a deepfake, and I'm still not sure that it was.","I had seen some news stoires about it, but not much more than that."
0c915ab3-0b4d-46c6-9aa0-312ad515ee65,7,It seemed to me that the cadence of his speech remained the same along with the tone of his speech.,"I was aware of deepfake images, but did not know that deepfake audio was a thing."
0cc517e4-5618-423d-9235-7fba054e17d2,7,he came off as a nice guy during the video,no i was unaware it was
0db2f619-3472-4642-8157-3b7429d584ff,7,i don't know. i don't what to look for.,i have seen some and they are disturbingly good.
0e70ffb8-2b19-4554-a4f5-c3de4f82bb6a,7,It seemed really lifelike.,I've heard of deepfakes but I don't know how to tell if a video is a deepfake or real.
0e79d629-255a-42d7-8151-689df32420ad,7,Chris sounded genuine and had appealing body language.He spoke like a real person.,I have never heard of deepfakes but I don't spend a lot of time on You Tube.I will be wary now!
0e890346-01fa-49cb-90ec-f373da68aaee,7,"i did not notice any cuts or manipulated video, seemed real to me",i knew of deepfakes and people having issues especially celebrities with such
0e994db1-ca18-48fb-b2f3-c27c1680b2b9,7,The voice seemed robotic and his stories weren't very interesting. His facial expression also didn't change much throughout,"Nope, i've never heard of it before! This is interesting to me though, but makes me wary of videos on the internet!"
0f92477c-053c-4b7d-af74-1dd2488655e8,7,It felt a bit phony,I have just heard about it
0fb58406-d72b-459f-89e7-6ccdd3204f7d,7,"It looked fairly authentic, he did seem rather stilted, but that would apply to the whole video rather than certain parts","Yes, I've seen a few deepfake videos"
10014735-4732-408b-9f20-4b7482c85f73,7,I watched the video and it looked very authentic in terms of the person speaking looking like they matched up with what they were saying and how they were saying it. Deepfakes tend to be quite jarring and even the best ones can seem a little off. I was trying to pay attention to Chris and it felt like the details about his face/mannerisms and how he spoke were like a real normal person.,Yes I've seen some before of celebrities or politicians. They generally look a little off or CGI simulated but they are getting better.
1026d219-b9e0-4a1b-bf8d-62c211f153db,7,Chris just seems too good to be true. His answers were bland and uninteresting.,No I was not aware of Deepfakes
10355924-b2fc-4d32-851c-52136ec4e29a,7,I was never suspicious that I wasn't watching a real person,I've never heard this term before
115bb46b-714d-496b-953c-f59a43bcd163,7,I wasn't viewing the video with the criteria that it may be fake. It did not occur to me that it might be.,I have seen Deepfaked content because my mother has sent it to me.
118f5003-fd82-470b-8f74-0b2e671c7fe1,7,The guy was just too perfect. Perfect responses. Made him look like the nicest guy in the world but he was too nice and maybe a little creepy,I obiously know of algorithms and artificial intelligence but i was unaware that they had advanced so much that chris' resonses may not of been real
119eaee4-ebac-411c-a5b4-35b964be65d1,7,I felt that I was watching an actual living person by the way that Chris spoke and moved and his facial expressions,I do not watch many youtube videos and was unaware that they could be Deepfaked
1218eabf-2151-4b70-b2b2-9270deeecb9a,7,I have a hard time believing that anybody would really say the things he did and post it to youtube.,I have heard of deepfake from the media but do not know if I have ever encountered it
126ec9ba-14c5-4161-ab05-b2bf1d7dce31,7,The things he stated are not things someone would share about themselves to an online platform in such a calm manner.,I have read articles about them
133ccb25-395e-4bc0-b060-fc790e385d24,7,I HAVE NO IDEA AND I DO NOT CARE ENOUGH ABOUT 'CHRIS' REAL OR FAKE.,NO.
136d8d9a-57e2-4980-9be5-bf85b3405acc,7,I don't think anyone trying to start a YouTube channel would answer the questions like he did. They would try to come off as nice as possible to get people to like them. Saying you wouldn't give up your seat on a bus for a heavily pregnant woman would not help.,I don't know what type of video was going to be shown so I can't assume.
1398edce-6624-4dcb-aa38-ce1c40ce0201,7,It appeared real - there were pauses and expression as expected.,How can I elaborate when i know nothing about it?? Never heard of it before!
13f6ee21-1d6f-43e6-9175-8dc4257f2bbc,7,I don't think I would spot the video being fake if it was as I haven't heard of deep faked before.  It looked totally genuine to me,I have never heard of deep faked before
14298cc1-972a-4694-bf0e-cee1e6552290,7,"While there were natural pauses, the words didn't really match Chris' facial expressions. He was saying some pretty selfish things but smiled about them quite a bit. It was very convincing though, so I'm not 100% confident.","I had heard about these on the radio, with the implications of deepfaking politicians being a particularly scary prospect."
14be33e3-39f8-4eaf-bfec-924e0b07a694,7,"Honestly no way of telling based purely on the technical details of the content. I'm inclined to think it was faked based on the fact that the speaker gave self-incriminating testimony which would likely have extremely negative professional (and quite possibly legal) consequences, something a real person likely would not do.",I've seen several news articles on the concept over the last couple of years.
15c9b850-0065-42c4-98c4-3085972e0f93,7,"I thought hat some of the things he said seemed 'weird"" or didn't fit with his demeanor and tone, but it never occured to me that it was fake until just now and it seems obvious.","Yes I was aware, but I wasn't expecting it here."
162b9e1e-eaf2-48a3-aee1-aa50e6a3a9d6,7,"the Video was real, however i don't believe some of what Chris said was genuine.","I watch movies and like CGI, (Computer generated images), so i wouldnt of been surprised if some aspects of the video were deepfaked."
1641ed3f-e43d-4dc8-b175-cedffb8c2f05,7,"It looked real, I have no reason for thinking that it could be faked.","Yes, i knew that because i saw many times videos on facebook which contained someones face but it wasnt real HIM"
19a10060-e5e3-404f-a0ba-c1ba78f9a276,7,"His voice seemed a little off, but was hard to tell because of the accent.","I knew it existed, but didn't realize just how effective the technique was."
19d1dcf6-42ab-4660-b07c-45d4e75c7519,7,"It looked real to me when I was watching, although I wasn't watching closely to spot a fake. I have seen deepfakes so if I was looking out for a one I think I could spot it.","I've seen deepfakes before, I am familiar with them."
1afcf5e6-c002-4f56-8c35-5f96fe541a09,7,I think the way chris moved was genuine.,I have watched various deepfake videos.
1cd3a092-e80a-4d65-83c2-06f725dd9caa,7,I thought it was genuine.,"I knew about Deepfakes before I did this study and that they are used to manipulate people into thinking someone had said something that they had not, because they can be quite convincing."
1cdb7fdf-9b23-44a8-8417-7b7e2a004c63,7,"it seemed very real to me  
",no never heard of this before
1d00fd1a-b20c-4c8f-a678-135eccd0085a,7,I don't think a person would say these things and admit to having these views online.,I have never heard of deepfake before.
1d490513-e094-465e-ac06-37683b45405a,7,"Chris was talking quite oddly, in a slow and over pronounced manner which seemed very unnatural.",I had never heard of this concept before this study.
1dc3fc08-bbe0-46d4-b167-e8e62eb19a78,7,Chris appeared robotic in some phrases. I am not sure if this is a sign of a deep fake.,"I have heard of deep fakes being used in the media and how dangerous they can be (politics, porn etc)"
1f5a37cc-bcba-4b99-b73e-973cd610ad94,7,it looked very real and convincing,i didn't know such a thing existed
1f7089ee-2393-494d-9ad7-1456a9d7346d,7,I Believe he was acting as i wouldn't want to think someone would genuinely hold those views,No i was completely unaware
203975ef-28ff-4d3c-b1c2-e7609c55e2fc,7,"Something felt off about it but I don't know if it's just because the content seemed pretty boring and he didn't seem to convey much of any emotion, but I still feel like it was a real video compared to the deepfakes I have seen",Yes I'm aware of deepfakes and have watched some example videos in the past
208ada0e-2606-4de1-8fa8-a2614d5a3500,7,The sentences and words flowed naturally and there wasn't any weird pauses or mispronouciations.,"I think I vaguely knew things like this have been mentioned in fictional tv shows, but I don't think it's actually real."
20bdebf4-6769-4749-aef8-738b6420f154,7,"It looked real and showed that Chris was self centred and a not very nice person.
The image of Chris looked real and the voice sounded in sync with Chris; lip movements.",I have never been told this before and I don't understand how it would work and I am a bit dubious if Deepfake even exists?
217da18f-8828-4429-aa1e-b9bfe129aab8,7,I think some of the things he was saying were a bit blunt and insensitive.,I have never heard of this term before.
2180a7f0-5f2d-4f48-bc58-1d8ba13c72b8,7,When he said  mean things there was a glitch on the video,I thought the video was real
21c8996b-5400-4f2a-b60d-83918664ed79,7,"I never considered that the video i watched could have been Deepfaked, although i did notice weird cuts in the video everytime he answered a new question.",I was aware it was something that could be done but have never seen one that i know of.
2400158d-13ab-4280-a21b-1fce5e68cda2,7,It seemed realistic and Chris seemed to have human movements and although the sentences were a bit formal and basic I could still imagine a real person saying those things. Watching the video I never noticed that anything was off or even thought it could be simulated.,I have heard of their existence and seen them in a comedic and quite crude setting where it's quite clear they are fake. I have never seen ones that are believable.
26133af4-31ee-49b1-8b64-15631c1d95db,7,I have never heard of deep-faking before so have no idea how you would know about it.,Not sure how I can elaborate on No. I have never heard of this.
26291bd7-d35a-4cb2-9cdc-7ddba6eb3aa7,7,He kind of souned like a robot,Yes content creators uses it all the time to promote products
263984cd-44b5-4104-b073-2ce4c15b5bd0,7,I belive it was genuine as the things he said was typically human.,was not aware of it to be honest
2644d27e-a663-45b0-9e6c-4b799eafec12,7,a computer algorithm was used to create the footage,no i was never aware until now.
268d0018-8c1a-487e-b676-f2a9e11664c5,7,the reason is his face did not follow what he was saying. His cheerful attitude was the opposite of how he looked.,It was only when you mentioned it that I realised the scene I saw looked wrong.
27cf913f-9b8b-441c-a0eb-856b728e765d,7,The thought that it might be Deepfaked never crossed my mind.,I know of very convincing text-generating programs but not any which also produce matching video content. (I'm still sceptical about this.)
28260f32-cf33-4aba-8ab7-efcd156a1e8b,7,I had no reason to suspect otherwise therefore never paid much attention to anything other than what he was saying,I was aware on the concept but not how complex they were.
2a837c2e-cc17-472b-ac93-7d68d5d86152,7,"I guess it could really be either, if the video wasn't deepfaked I'm guessing Chris is being intentionally sarcastic. I'm going to say it was deep-faked though just based on his answers being intentionally offensive.","I was aware of deepfakes but didn't know it had come this far. Very scary stuff, makes recognizing the truth a lot harder."
2b1c89dd-6473-4c8e-8bf2-ecf45c34ba03,7,His moth appeared to be in sync with the audio.,I have listened to podcasts in relation to deepfaked videos particularly political ones and fake news.
2b2b0e7a-fb80-49b4-a1f5-929cf40792a4,7,"The entire video sounded and looked completely real to me. I didn't like some of the things he said, but I don't think it was Deepfaked.",I had a bit of knowledge on Deepfakes. I once watched a video on Ellen's YouTube channel where a comedian was doing impressions of different celebrities and at one point in the video he started to look like the celebrity he was imitating. The comments on the video made me realize what Deepfake was.
2b7a7733-fe8b-48f0-a917-f02c8ef3b9f8,7,"The answers given were abruptly honest, like caring for his grandmother only to be bequeathed her home when she passed away, and artificial intelligence would be gathering from answers more tailored to want people want to hear. Ergo, I believe this was genuine, if potentially tongue in cheek.","I have only a cursory awareness of deepfakes, and I suppose it's quite possible I didn't recognize one here."
2bccb86b-d2b3-478e-80d2-ceea28d4c30d,7,"he seemed genuine when giving answers, it didn't seem computerized.",i didnt know such thing exsisted.
2cf32f98-cdc9-447a-9c85-d0031e945b0e,7,"I think a human would know better than to say something of the things Chris said in that video, such as not giving his seat up for a pregnant lady is her problem, and that he's only getting close to his Grandmother to get her house after she passes away. Of course this is the youtube world though, and some people deliberately say things like that to get views.",No. I had no idea it was a thing. I'm quite shocked that technology is capable of such things.
2d779616-b41c-4147-9f60-01e7d1a32b22,7,As far as I could see I would never say it was a fake,I guess it's very hard to tell between real and fake
2dd9c535-724a-4c37-8e43-7429003b1ea1,7,there was nothing in the video that was particularly interesting or offensive. Don't know why you would fake it.,I have never heard the term but I do know that not everything is true.
2e795430-2c18-48f8-a70c-c427fcd59689,7,"The video really put Chris in a negative light. Even if those things were true, I don't know if Chris would advertise that to lots of potential viewers on Youtube. It also seemed like Chris remained very still within the frame. I think it would be significantly more challenging to convincingly fake the range of motion you get from a real video.","Yes, I knew that videos could be made to appear real despite the audio/visuals being manipulated."
318dc133-bc26-434d-ad66-cac3ab88781d,7,He said things that somebody wouldn't typically share to youtube however it could be a trick.,I remember a video of mark zuccerberg being made
31ab3b52-3421-4599-a90a-c1e705da8483,7,I Believe that Chris is a person who doesn't feel the way he said he did and it was all part of an act.,I was aware that people can lie on screens in order to make them out to be someone that they are not and I believe this is the case.
31b9629a-e519-408c-9928-a9c12aab69c1,7,"i dont really know, but i watched it and did not sense any weirdness or inconsistency in the video",i have a background in computer science and have encountered some articles and videos about deep fakes before
3516bd1e-d771-4620-ae4b-9043b977e9ec,7,because he had no emotions showing at all,People put on a show for views
3548841c-57de-42c9-af2c-efe78d97e675,7,I was uncomfortable with the lip sync and mouth movements.,I was aware but not really knowledgeable on the matter
358c6a1a-aa10-40f6-b48c-e201d3eb4d45,7,His voice was quite monotonous and didnt completely match,I assumed it wasnt because I was told it was a normal video.
37abc5cf-f851-4f05-811f-a581e7b48ccc,7,"It just didn't occur to me to think that it was deepfaked at the time, although I did find what he said was very odd and no likeable.  I simply took it at face value.  However, on reflection, what he was saying didn't tally with his expression, making me think that it was deepfaked.","No, I'm not that aware of this type of thing and don't use youtube for these types of videos so I wasn't aware of it."
382d5628-eda5-49ea-841f-f8d684b42cb0,7,"His lips and facial expressions seemed to match with what he was saying, as far as I could see anyway.","I have never heard of this before, this comes as a surprise to me."
38c086d3-c7fb-4148-976b-77476da56f76,7,It seemed very natural!,"Yes, and i think it's soon going to make video evidence of anything obsolete!"
39056d5b-6a76-426d-89ec-286ea9ed37cb,7,"At the time i was watching the video i did actually think that it was just any normal video of someone speaking and looked real to me, but, now you have mentioned 'Deepfake' i remember the video very well and that it does not actually look 100% real! 
I remember, looking back at the video, that the way he was speaking was a fraction 'robotic' and not 100% natural.","I was not aware that videos could be 'deepfaked'.  
This is new to me. 
"
395ca4a0-f3b3-46e0-a127-e89353b08a81,7,There were no comments to verify if he had been asked these kinds of questions therefore I didn't think it was real.,I was not familiar with the term deepflakes. I know people are often credited with saying things they never said or things that they have said being taken out of context and manipulated to be used against them.
398217a6-cc07-447c-adca-b64fed2be333,7,"It seemed very real, like he was actually talking",I have never heard of this term before
3adb5575-79a0-4d4c-ad3b-524cdaadfe67,7,Never crossed my mind that it might not be a real person.,"Yes I was v aware, its use political reasons and others e.g. porn"
3b12fd88-3857-4bfc-9f2e-66db96ac8dd2,7,His eye movements seemed real,I had heard of it but don't know much about it or how it works
3b6eaab1-fdd8-4179-8099-10b87f46d8ed,7,I think the videos I saw were deepfaked as while Chris had a very nice face and a very calm voice he was saying some horrible things,I have heard of Artificial Intelligence but have not heard the word deepfake
3e245357-de32-4382-bcec-17009f05340e,7,it was too mean to be real,i didnt know it was athing
3ec83700-32f1-43b1-81ad-0efdb5704874,7,I saw no evidence of Deepfake and it looked genuine,"Take sound from other videos of speech and ""dub""other videos"
3f482ae0-5bf9-4631-8c33-b4c2df58feab,7,"i dont know what Chris' real voice sounds like , so i,ve nothing to compare it with","yes, i have read about them before a few monthys ago"
3fbdab52-a175-488d-8c45-d5da357470aa,7,I felt that it was sincere but am now wondering...I wouldn't share unless was absolutely sure.,I don't think I really knew that videos could be DeepFaked tho I don't trust everything I see online ... I tended to think that possible Chris might be insincere
40e16579-6fa3-4da4-9297-06b90f727354,7,Surely no one could be that offensive,I do not think this could be genuine
41305633-526c-4ed6-a273-461ffdf4ee82,7,he was way too kind and caring seemed over the top,"no i wasnt until it was mentioned aboved seemed deep faked because he was too nice 


"
41df16f3-1ae0-4d41-8719-9fb7e583ba5e,7,I thought it looked a bit odd but thought it was just glitchy. Now you have said there is  a chance it is fake it makes more sense,I had never heard of it before and didn't know it was a thing
43fc0b9b-b7ec-495d-b882-d3d4728f457e,7,"The way it was cobbled together seemed very unprofessional. The background was very plain, like it was just put in there after the fact.","I have seen several examples of this online before, and have listened to podcasts about it."
442981a1-5fea-45f1-9c71-50be33b892b3,7,mentioned people and grandparebt,never heard of deepfaked. though people would be genuine
445c2113-c663-4c73-81b8-e2ef923be529,7,The reason I think it was genuine is because it was so innocous. It was bland. It did not say anything weird or controversial. Why bother to do a deepfake of a person answering general questions about his ordinary life?,I saw a demonstration on a morning tv show once. It was eery the way they faked the hostess saying things she never actually said. I think it would take an expert to tell them apart.
452248c5-1675-48d7-a4ad-0b4b552a8dde,7,"He was saying things like ""I would only spend time with my grandmother so I can get the house"" this seemed deepfaked as no one would really say that online and he also said he cheated in a final exam which can be very bad if a job company find this out.","I knew there was ways to make it seem like people said the wrong things but upon viewing the youtube video, and if it is deepfaked, then I did not know how advanced it truly is."
45cd1927-ad28-43b1-bbd1-c6b52ea2ad4f,7,It was very helpful for me to known that it was a deepfaked video.,Deepfakes are synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness
45d9ef43-f99a-4e08-8123-1c25edd0a769,7,It didnt look dubbed or like a fake person whilst I was watching each clip. There were definitely changes in how he was sat or the lighting but it all looked genuine.,"Never heard of this, I feel like it would be really obvious almost with a cartoon edge or when something is badly super imposed into a movie for example."
46ad7483-f1d6-49ec-bca0-3bbc58012209,7,Didn't cross my mind that it could not have been real,Have not come across them
47018ced-da6f-4219-ba73-bd5521a167a6,7,"This video was real. I don't believe Chris was his real name but that's not the point. I believe it to be real and not deepfaked because he clearly had very human features; skin complexion and tonality, tone of voice, response time etc....., I believe he was trying to make out he was very un human like by answering the questions in a very neutral way. One of the questions was about chivalry and whether or not he agreed with it, he answered: no, i don't believe in it - if a pregnant woman came onto the bus, I wouldn't give up my seat"" he isn't lying or hiding anything here and doesn't show any remorse or guilt - this is how most people would percieve deepfake content, they see real people as too kind and not wanting to make a bad impression...Chris was the anthesis of this - he simply didn't care - which is why I believe the video of him speaking to be 100% real. I also think the people who are making me take this survey want me to be fooled by that, they want me to be under the illusion that because ""unkind and unthoughtful"" things were said that only deepfake's can produce such shockery - incorrect.","I'm not at all knowledgeable on deep fakes but I can imagine them. How they're made, the process involved etc..... I cannot say a thing on that."
472ab3a2-fb41-4eee-ad48-cf22e5336718,7,I believe the video was genuine and only made for the purpose of this study.,I had seen a Youtube video on this concept in the past year.
483fc201-90ce-4d2e-be0d-43de38ab6db8,7,"he seemed really unnatural when he was speaking, with minimal facial expression.",I use the internet. I know about Deepfakes.
4914599b-3178-4af5-8a0a-1b2ba498f884,7,He was very still and expressionless and also I think a normal human would know they would incur alot of hostility saying some of those things.,I have seen programmes about it.
49fa555f-b3d7-400c-8597-6dab8492fec0,7,The person seemed genuine and like he was answering honestly. I've known people like him so that mostly made me suspect that it was a real person.,I've read stories on the internet of how videos can be deepfaked.
4a24d85f-16fc-46f8-9542-6e1508a03d7c,7,He seemed very robotic and kept looking at the camera without blinking at one point.. Creeped me out a little,"Very interesting concept, will definitely research more about it after this study."
4e35326e-5e5e-49ce-b3bf-4bf7008214db,7,I watched it closely and the video seemed to be an actual person and he seemed to be saying the words I could see and readI,I am aware of lots of fakes and inauthentic things on the internet

4fba3805-9e90-4c50-977d-663fa03fbe6c,7,It seemed real and geniune.,I've seen it recently in the news.
4fd62753-984a-4442-88fb-b76e7db39067,7,Chris looked and sounded like a genuine person.  It did not sound robotic and he was answering questions,I have never heard of this before.
50ebdde4-ab91-43d4-9ae5-550c00302478,7,It seemed a typical YouTube blog kinda video.,I have never heard of Deepfakes.
51820a61-1c4f-41bd-9080-d7a37bfecadb,7,Everything seemed normal,Dont think that deepfaking a video can still result in good quality
51c2462d-8247-4246-85d1-eb5d29b5d19b,7,his eyes seemed to be truthful,I knew that avotars could be made where they were so realistic you might not be able to tell the difference but I had not heard of deepfakes
51cd4c07-49f2-4a86-bc8c-24eac66d7a33,7,"It was cut into segments, not done in one go, and had a blank wall behind him. He didn't move much in some of the segments and seemed to be overly enunciating, and speaking quite slowly. This could be that English is a second language or that he is doing it on purpose but it did seem a bit over the top. Also, the lighting seemed to change in each segment.",I had not heard of the specific term but knew videos could be manipulated/faked.
557c79f9-4bd2-494d-8c54-c660a3420783,7,I think I watched a Deepfaked video because Chris' voice was extremely level and monotone and he looked directly at the camera with very little motion of his eyes or head. The way he said things did not seem very natural.,"No, this is something completely new to me, I wouldn't have considered this to be an option, but if a video didn't give me a good feeling I'd move on and not like/share/subscribe."
569138ed-30c5-4873-a4cb-28ab885ee1dc,7,"The video seems genuine to me, but I don't know enough about Deepfaking to be able to spot a video that has been Deepfaked unless it is obviously not a real person.",I have not heard of Deepfaking before.

5750ff06-84a1-40e7-bf73-4b32599cfe8a,7,The words were in said in line with the movement of his mouth.,I have watched movies with voice overs were the person did not actually say that.
57b2f810-e8e1-44f5-8762-c88b1bc888d6,7,The facial expression was not very natural while the emotions feels a bit 'jagged'. Feels like a deepfake right from start.,"I studied computer science for the last 4 years now and am very aware of this technology. The video was pretty obvious to be a deep fake and could have been improved. The facial expression sold it off while the overall 'quality' was ok, not to un natural except the expressions"
5836bddc-9f21-4593-a8da-097cc065442e,7,i think this could possibly have been fake as he was quite slow in places to answer but this could also be due to him thinking about what he had to say.,"no i was not aware of this, and now that i am will be careful about future videos that i watch and take notice of"
5acb3779-ffa4-452d-a7da-8446898a800d,7,I think he was real as his facial expressions seemed genuine.,I don't think I've seen any but I am aware it is possible
5b2989a7-dd9f-40a3-846f-f2c9512033e1,7,I think it was genuine as it seemed like he was talking in his house.,I wasn't aware of the concept but I can understand how it can be done using the advanced technologies available.
5b403208-4b9b-48be-b841-a9dd6e95047e,7,The conversation seems natural with human conversational inflections and matching of the facial speech muscles.,I have seen educational videos with examples of how people may manipulate existing video contents to construct a fake video of people making certain speeches or claims that they never did.
5b6c1b70-e63d-4e58-b0b4-648f0ac1779e,7,at times his sentences and speech sounded a little 'darlicky' and didnt come across as  fluid.  They also were not very interesting,No i had never heard of this before
5c147840-e85d-4c9f-b232-db99a8f7bdc6,7,"with the more emotive questions and answers he gave, such as helping his gran at the weekend before she passes, it was so blunt, there was no change in tone of voice or non communication that goes with giving an answer like that. everything was to the point,nothing was added on,we didnt get a reason of how his help helped his friend. there was no pauses or words such as 'like' in a nervous way, if he had only just started doing these videos he wouldnt be so confident, in my opinion.",i guess there was a broad generalisation of fake news that im aware off. but in this study i believed everything was true up until this point and having reflected.
5e3e1dd4-9f29-4950-8a9f-f1872e60d546,7,I've seen deepfakes and it looked too genuine and real.,I've watched them.
5fe152f6-f0a3-484d-ad96-930bc47ebbba,7,"His facial expressions seemed to match what he was saying, I believe it was genuine. Nevertheless I admired the honesty of the video and thats why I slightly like him.","I'd probably heard of it beforehand, but the actual concept of deepfaked was never on my mind during the video and its not something I think I'd even have thought about!"
60001f38-8157-42e3-b5f5-f2a496e1a655,7,His words matched with his facial expressions and the movements of his mouth.,I knew that images but not sounds could be faked.

60a6fd27-cfbf-4a9b-aa43-74da56cf0114,7,the video tha I watched seemed somewhat real from what I saw and heard,i was not aware of such tech in the world
60e665ee-2418-4844-9568-43245770faa5,7,"It seems unrealistic that Chris, who seems to be a nice enough person in the way that he presents himself, would admit to being so cruel in his responses.","I have read about deepfakes online, but to my knowledge have not seen any deepfake videos."

62e8cded-40d3-4ed9-9bcf-86ec68e6e3a0,7,The video showed chris to be genuine and friendly,I dont even know what this term means
632fdf8e-d668-4cc2-8148-02d817d38b7f,7,"The video looked genuine enough and I could not spot anything major which may indicate it was artificial. However, there were few edits and Chris occasionally appeared with a slightly different hair style which I put down him trying to edit the video better but I am guessing now was the work of algorithms.",I was not aware that they could be made to look very genuine.
63e35ac3-fe33-4b8c-88bd-ee0733e6d4ab,7,"It looked real, but what he said does get me thinking to, did he actually say that.",Did not know anything about deepfaked before.
641d7c7e-1d12-4d12-a81b-71ccae8bcdfc,7,"I have seen some deepfaked content before and it seemed very realistic, i suppose theres a chance it could be as ive only seen amateur deepfaking but it really didnt seem fake in the video","I've seen some deepfaked content in comedic videos and of course some high budget stuff in movies, ive also heard of nefarious deepfakes"
6430e75e-0633-4106-9c78-55326e4f7b68,7,"Facial expressions seemed legitimate, words matched up with face, everything seemed legimate and normal.",I saw some deepfakes at a glace probably in some news video or something. I have very surface level knowledge of the topic and barely understand more than just knowing the technology exists
644f123e-8e3c-47e1-99d9-5a095d2b019c,7,it seems to be a real video because the facial expression and mouthing of Chris shows he was talking and far from deepfaked,i have heard about if but i have not watched any deepfaked content before now or probably I have but I did not know it was deepfaked
69bad028-cf65-431c-9087-c9c20a9b0e63,7,"Everything matched - intonation, expression, etc. Of course I could be wrong, but if I am it was very convincing.",I know about them but had yet to see one that was good enough to pass.
69c1c2bf-0afa-436d-b5d6-a800bb9421bc,7,He was kinda rude guy for a video like this. I don't believe he could think like that about his grandma.,"No, I wasn't. Because you bring it up, I think there is possibility it was Deepfaked."
6aacbf6e-b0fd-4cd9-b474-0906f46edddd,7,"My reason is because when I saw Chris, in the video he looks like a decent respectful gentleman, after he started saying some of the things he said I was disappointed and in shock and disbelief and couldn't believe he said those things.","No, I was unaware about deepfakes videos, I am actually quite shocked and have learned something new."
6e5a1357-54eb-4028-a3af-567b5b68e4bc,7,I think this video was real and acted/created for this study,I was not aware a video could be faked to the point even the person looks like they are saying the speech that may be dubbed over them
6ee4e2d7-cab2-4412-9a1f-3b9ca89be979,7,well i think it was,yes all videos can bedeepfaked if you know how
711c648e-30b3-44c1-a7e1-b528b3b055f7,7,As I was watching the video I noticed that the rhythm was off and even the inflection of words plus it slowed down when I didn't expect it to.,"I have known about people who take videos and edit them in such a way to make it sound as if the person said something when it was the opposite. I saw this a lot during the last four years of conservatives making claims against liberals. These people just picked up on links on YouTube and shared them, not that they edited the videos themselves and posted them; they simply believed that the video was real. I did research on the same video (usually the original was a press conference and on a news site in its entirety) and it was nothing like the edited one. I reposted the original video and called out those people who posted the edited one, telling them they were manipulated and that the claim they made was not true based on the full unedited video on YouTube."
7155c4bd-a51a-40f0-ba32-77a5644ac36d,7,I don't think deepfakes have acquired the ability yet to seamlessly speak (although I'm now not entirely convinced),I know it was becoming an issue with pornography where people were making fake videos and selling them. Governments started to intervene.
7338bfc7-45c6-4f7f-a90b-bc40461d7f0b,7,"Although the video seemed to jump cut, I thought that was the way the video was edited, but I couldn't tell any other editing but that",I have seen things being Deepfaked before
733a6aa9-04e0-4ac4-8ed7-15140da5df70,7,It appeared to be an authentic video although it did seem odd how he would not move his head whilst speaking.,Deepfakes are videos that are AI manipulated.
7453ddb3-997e-4525-9034-cfaef30e9fe9,7,I don't think Chris would say he's visiting his grandmother because she's old and he wants to be left her house.,I realise photos and videos can be faked but not this well
750a3aff-dc65-4955-82f1-73b32a4d0a86,7,"I watched it and my opinion is that it was real,the voice sounded human, his lips moved to the words.",I have never heard of such a thing.
76b60c54-7899-4261-88f3-fceb7ab027ed,7,It seemed genuine. Didn't enter my head it wasn't as I thought Chris is a comedian.,I have heard of Deepfake videos.
76c97da7-15db-4b8f-a760-61dc7030b8a2,7,I had no reason to believe the video was faked as it seemed very genuine and authentic.  I believed the video I was watching.,I had never heard of the term deepfaked before today.
77fe163a-d554-4be3-be4e-087ddbd36b11,7,"I have never heard of deep faking. When I watched him I felt uncomfortable and although he was saying things that normally would make me warm to him - e.g. looking after his grandmother while he could, I felt no empathy and felt quite cold towards him. Physically he is pleasant and engaging and looks trustworthy and honest but I didn't feel I could trust him, he seemed non-genuine. His talk seemed quite stilted as though reading a script. If it was the real guy sorry!",I don't watch youtube often and have never heard of this before. I know photos can be edited to make them appear different so I guess not impossible to manipulate videos too.
7850d9aa-23f1-4952-8123-bafb2eadf0cd,7,His voice seemed to suit him and the general vibe he gave off was wholesome enough to fit those answers. But also maybe he seemed too wholesome and a little vanilla. So I'm not 100% sure,I've seen Deepfake videos before where people put celebrities faces on other peoples bodies etc and I'm aware that it's used in propaganda videos
78d0dd8b-7f31-4772-aaa3-8d7457454a2c,7,"When I was watching it, it seemed authentic but I remember noting that something about Chris seemed a bit off. Then again it could just be his personality. I think it was authentic because the audio and his lips seemed to match perfectly and something I've noticed with some deep fakes are that the eyes look a little dead when they speak; there's no light behind them.

Honestly, I still don't know if it was real or not, but I would guess that it was real because to me Chris's eyes seemed real.","Prior to this, I was aware that they exist as well as the dangers. I know that some deep fakes are made entirely for humorous purposes but I've also seen videos of ""Obama"" giving speeches that have been tweaked by the deepfake programmes ever so slightly and it is really convincing.

Our eyes are one of our most trusted senses and video footage is considered concrete in most settings so the presnece of deepfakes that are so convincing are really quite terrifying. In the future, I would imagine it will be impossible to tell fact from fiction."
79ad2531-de2d-4233-ae0e-d429a1823d44,7,"While watching the video, it seemed completely natural, and although I didn't like the things he was saying, nothing stood out as weird or fake to me so I completely believed it.","I have seen a few deepfaked videos, and am impressed by how realistic they are.  However there was always something slightly ""off"" about them that made them fairly visible fakes."
79c2b0c5-1ee0-43df-ac1e-a12eb4582a6c,7,"I thought the whole video was fluent, there were no glitches in his speech and he seemed to be breathing as a normal person would.",I have never heard of the term.
7b4ff077-40de-4aa6-86ef-b539818a56f9,7,"I thought that the top half of his face never moved while he was talking, which made me think that something wasn't right.  I hadn't considered that it might be deepfaked, but that seems a plausible explanation.  That, or Chris has very fine motor control  I also didn't really think he believed the things he was saying.","But now you have enlightened me, it seems entirely plausible.  The technology clearly exists, and it makes me rather concerned as to what governments or others might do with such tech."
7b6cdfa0-3631-464c-bb06-3c0776019e03,7,He seemed to be genuine,Never heard of the term before
7ba5e650-c90d-4fef-88e4-a2b776880d0d,7,"I had no reason to believe, when watching it, that the videos were Deepfaked. I have never seen it done before so I am assuming that it would be fairly obvious when videos were Deepfaked.",I have never heard of this.
7c804f36-a4c8-482e-beff-471a9dcb2dd4,7,"While I don't think I would question it with being asked, his face showed little expression and the footage was chopped together - also the neutral background may be useful for creating deep fakes?",I've heard about them on the news
7d2aaef1-2128-42ca-8c6b-d3f21cd04dde,7,Chris was a bit too good to be true and by the end of the video I did not believe everything he said.  He made himself sound too nice,I was aware of fake news and videos being manipulated but had not heard the phrase Deepfakes
7dac6e7f-86b8-4460-b575-e6f038787282,7,Seemed like a genuine person to me.,This is the first time I have heard of Deepfakes

801ea519-2af4-4afd-8b1a-8479dd7372a0,7,"I don't believe so? I noticed that his speech wasn't standard but attributed this to a non-English accent, but it's possible it could have been dubbed.",I was aware but have limited experience of this.
80709d26-1ce8-40b4-b620-49df3ff94327,7,incongruous,I have not encountered this term
80c2b846-f5cb-4339-a8ba-46b206cd4893,7,I thought he sounded real and honest.,I had no previous knowledge of this.
8111e8af-fe3f-466a-aa70-421c7c186fbc,7,Didn't look natural,Knew it could be done but don't really think about it too much.
826624b4-eb1c-4681-8500-8191ba738cb3,7,It looked genuine and his mouth seemed to match what he said,I had never heard of it before

84d12d98-9304-4cfe-a72c-db0a74c7bf0a,7,It seemed like it was smooth and him talkinh,I wasnt looking for it but was aware its possible
8570ce4a-6248-4ee7-9f74-669797cc18ce,7,I didn't pay much attention to what Chris was doing but more what he was saying and I didn't find anything odd.,I had only heard about rumors of something like this but wasn't aware it was an actual thing.
85d70748-b23e-488c-b276-e5fbe2a0413e,7,Though it was edited in a slightly strange way,Never heard of it
8661f861-7aaf-4d7d-9e45-3d035d6d3779,7,"I had the suspicion it was deep-faked, irregular blinking",I have seen a lot of examples of it

I heard a programme on radio 4 talking about them. to my knoweldge I have not seen actual deepfake but i would not necessarily know.
86de9731-0d06-4741-81ba-3c686446603b,7,"At points, the audio and Chris were slightly out of sync, leading me to believe that there is a fair chance that the video was Deepfaked.",I knew of Deepfakes prior to this study and am vaguely familiar with how they are created.
86f8976e-7c8f-4e41-898b-7dfe43240369,7,"As I was watching it, I was aware of awkward speech patterns and pauses.","I knew videos can be faked and voiced can be dubbed - I've seen the bad lip readings, for example. But this -if deep faked - was better quality than I was aware of."
87026088-277c-41e8-9108-3d31ceaded0d,7,I'd like it to be the authentic person! I think it was real because of the sounds I heard when he smiled and the noise from the movement of his mouth.,I only heard of this this year. It was something related to fake news - there was a video I THINK where Obama was speaking and they had mashed words from other videos and speeches together to make it sound like a continuous 'genuine' speech.
87853ab8-bc81-4ffe-8c24-1b306daa40e4,7,"While watching the video, I never considered for a moment that he was not saying these things. I only noticed a couple of changes to his hair/appearance and lighting. Which is to be expected if they were filmed at different times.","I have heard about it but never seen it. I believe it would usually be used involving politicians/celebrities making fake/political statements, therefore I was not suspicious watching someone I didn't recognise as famous, making non-political statements."
8b280ef3-92ee-45ae-be4f-0656c2e79487,7,"I believe the video is authentic because Chris sounds very natural, with small hesitations and even a bit of a sing-song voice that is a sign of someone who knows he is on camera.","I read, listen and watch a lot of news and information programs, so I have heard this expression before."
8cbcabf3-d538-4f59-8d50-ca2f82a3e48c,7,You could hear when his mouth moved,I had heard of the concept before
8ceeebcd-bdf3-4e31-a2b6-897f07331c58,7,The answers to some of the questions lacked authenticity. The question about helping someone at university did not feel true.,"I had heard about Deepfake videos in the news and in newspapers, but I had not experienced or seen a Deepfake video (that I am aware of)."
8e75b7b8-9b91-4ae6-bb9e-49fcc781605e,7,"It all fitted together although a couple of bits of dialogue had not translated well and jarred - maybe it was AI generated! He used the word ""any"" inappropriately but thought it might be because he had a foreign accent and was not a native English speaker. It is also hard to separate the person from the dialogue, eg Chris seems like a person but then he says things that you would not advise anyone to say in public so either he lacks an emotional filter or is acting in some way or is a Deepfake.","Had never heard of this and it concerns me as it was hard for me to tell whether this particular video was genuine or not, some method of authentication is needed to flag Deepfakes up or screen them out of circulation as they are deceptive."
90d3e68f-abd8-49f5-9e7d-915ccfae398e,7,"I felt when I was watching the video that he may have scripted what he wanted to say, but felt he was genuine about what he says. The only reason I would believe it was deepfaked is because what he said was somewhat cruel, or an unpopular opinion, such as not being chivalrous.","I have heard of deepfaking, but I have never seen anything that was produced well enough to not actually know it was fake."
9189abb9-72e4-4862-ad4c-beb0ff4f7474,7,"I feel like his tone was very genuine, though his answers were quite generic",I'd heard of them and had seen a few video essays about Deepfakes
92a8268c-8130-46a7-a4d4-22df9c696e27,7,Nothing looked strange to me,"I saw memes about it, although they weren't convincing that is was real since it was a joke."
93c34851-9fdd-4101-bbad-4df474ae27aa,7,"He didn't seem entirely real.  He was a bit removed, despite the postive things he was saying.  He just didn't ring true.",I have never heard of this term before.
94af1834-c75c-492a-922b-3a9c9f74eb02,7,I think it was deep faked because the things he was saying weren't nice and many people wouldn't express those views online.,I had never heard of this before
94ebb600-6a1e-4616-9cf5-364c18b9fdb0,7,"The movement of the lips did not seem to match up with the sound. At the time I thought the sound might be out of sync, but the movement still didn't quite match up - there was just something odd about it.","I am aware of the term deepfake, although I don't know where from. I am not overly familar with them, but think I have come across something about them in the news relating to x-rated material of people."
9616ca64-1861-4a53-ad90-5c68e831a836,7,I think I was watching an authentic person and their responses.,"Interesting, I have never come across such a definiton. Here was the first time."

I also think it was deepfaked because he answers to questions were weird. His answer about his siblings was impersonal-sounding (they live a bus ride away). HIs answer about college was also slightly off-topic and in college you take more than one exam, so it was weird. It's not that his answers were wrong but they were just enough off-topic that it felt like a weird way to answer. I obviously thought Chris' answer about his weekends was also manipulative and awful, but it was so frank that it also felt weird - even a person who would visit their grandmother just to inherit wouldn't say it that way.","I've seen deepfaked videos online and looked at articles on AI-generated images and videos, and how to recognize them."

He was very cold to the point it seemed inhuman.,"No, if it was all done by AI then I am scared as it looked pretty convincing!"
b299d32d-f540-46ab-8077-046e770c5f97,7,"Whilst there did seem to be something uncanny about the video, I'd put this down to the fact that the actor was reading from a script rather an ad-libbing rather than to the fact that it was Deepfaked. All of the answers were bland, so I suppose it could have been Deepfaked, but the person in the video seemed real.","Yes, I've seen some video on youtube of actors Deepfaked into movies that they were never in (Arnie as Rambo, for example), and heard some Deepfake audio of Joe Rogan."

It seemed fake in the way he was acting, but it hadn't occurred to me that is was a deepfake. But only now that has been pointed out, there were bits of the video where it looked like his mouth movements weren't matching the audio, but I put it down to the audio being out of sink. But I couldn't be definitely sure if the video I watched was deepfaked or not.","I know of deepfakes, but don't know if any video I've seen has been a deepfake.

So, I believe that the video I saw was genuine.","I have seen some manipulated videos before, many that could have been convincing if I hadn't had prior knowledge of the person(s) involved in the video to know what wasn't true or real."
df058672-ceae-4cff-bbbd-8af5d230d890,7,the video seems legit of a normal person talking and giving true answers about himself,"i had no idea, i really thought it was a real person giving answers about some questions with true answers."
df6e994b-1573-4853-8dce-35547816b9ae,7,It looked quite authentic and as if it was really his face/ him talking,"I have heard of deepfake videos and some uses for them, but i have not researched or watched enough about them to know the extent of how convincing a deepfake can be"
df7c3457-b5cf-49be-9896-8d8820a5944b,7,his facial expressions/mouth movements seem genuine and also all his facts seemed like they would be said by the same person (i.e. the facts all shared the same character/personality),i know there was controversy about celebrities being deepfaked onto pornographic videos and that was a very large issue
e28f2de3-9adf-46cb-a9d8-d72f65015f20,7,Appeared very real and in sync- very believable,Never heard of it
e2e3eb84-e66d-45f3-b461-4fdbadbe8bd1,7,He just seemed real. His actions seemed human and there wasn't anything too off about him.,"I was aware of it, but I haven't seen much of them."
e39d812b-7cfd-48d0-8d37-e4c0c738c625,7,I think this is the right for this,I don't know about this
e3e9ace9-87ad-406d-ad14-e40c8b701b87,7,the way he  an say sad things without any emotion and how his emotions changed so quickly.,I was aware of deep faked videos because it is also the same in fake news and the images on those are often fake
e41413a7-0935-47cd-a0cd-576b1085aa81,7,"He looked very real to me and seemed like a very very nice guy, giving up his seat for pregnant woman, hanging out with his ageing grandma on the weekend before she passes away, I mean, what is there not to like, he's almost perfect :)","This is the first time that I have ever heard of this word, and if it is true, it is very scary.  People are doing things on u-tube, showing before and after pictures that are suppose to indicate progress on something they have started.  If Chris was fake, now I will have to question each video that I see because he looked totally real and nice to me."
e4c10108-3e19-43fa-bfc1-c2758b1af832,7,I can imagine Chris saying those things.,I had not heard of deepfakes before
e5773c5c-3a88-4995-ab82-630d8dd67aa5,7,"His answers seems genuine, genuine speaking style, with natural pauses, etc.",I hadn't really thought about it and it makes sense given how the world is changing but I was not aware of it prior to the study
e5b961bf-a921-4281-bdc8-0a8df0cf03f3,7,Everything he said was consistent across all snippets.,I've read articles on it
e62ca545-dd2f-495f-9102-f35d19dc2e59,7,"Honestly I'm  not sure, more like facial expressions was what I noticed...  but it was also kind of weirdly segmented so difficult.",I didn't know
e775e50a-5d54-46b5-88aa-0ed993bfbcdf,7,Giving the names of his siblings seemed like genuine realistic information.,Deepfaked is not something I have ever heard of before.
e8457c07-9ca6-428a-a435-1878c83eff1c,7,"It looked real, maybe over pronounced things but lips looked like he was saying the words",Seen it on news programmes
e929c3be-2f45-426d-b49c-5311c94bace1,7,Everything seemed so ultimately measured and his expression didn't change much.,I am aware of how deepfakes are very convincing.
ec1848fa-17ef-44e5-8404-abc3e0e0888b,7,i thought the video was genuine because i saw chris's eye and mouth movement almost like i could see his emotions,i just didn't think it was
ec1b22ff-a455-4cd5-a93d-7fab2666e6ef,7,"I think Chris said things that no one would actually say. As in, he wouldn't give up a seat to a pregnant lady even though she needs it more than he does. He also had robotic movements.","I was aware of the concept, but I had never seen a video or anything with a deepfake."
ecc1b691-b4ed-47b7-849b-172fa315cc04,7,"I've never heard of deepfaked, and the video appeared to me to be completely genuine, so if this had not been mentioned, I would have selected the option that the video was genuine.  However, I have put the answer above as deepfaked, because it seems so improbable that anyone would create a youtube channel with such negative statements.","No, I have never heard of this before."
ed12365c-f5ca-490f-9aae-0fc1dea6589b,7,The response to the questions was sequence enough than to Deepfake it.,I have watched a video clip of a President speech which was actually Deepfaked. I believed the content of the clip until the same President claimed that he did not say what video projected and he later released the video of his original interview.
ede5e25e-c1bb-4fe4-b05c-d9446cc87c1b,7,it seemed as though Chris was being genuine but I suppose we will never know.,I wouldn't of thought it was deep faked until I read do you think the video was genuine or deep faked then it make me question anything is possible.
eeb49f6d-2e8c-439d-8547-df11d5672013,7,He said very generic things,I didn't know about this
ef2c55e6-b9f9-4952-9875-670fc7021638,7,"To be honest, I'm now doubting myself, but I didn't see anything to make me particularly suspicious that it had been deepfaked. That said, the content was surprising! Hence, I'm now doubting myself yet sticking with the above answer.","I've heard this discussed in the media previously, though I'm not sure if I've yet to see an example of deepfaked content. Perhaps I have unknowingly...even in this study!"
efc83be7-0cbc-423d-a5f8-ea3915c1215b,7,"I saw no reason to believe that the content was not real. However, my focus was almost entirely on the sub-titles - I paid little attention to either the voice or the visuals of the actor.","I am aware of the concept, but have no experience or in-depth knowledge of the subject."
f087c89e-33d0-4097-af63-9bf5e6f09b82,7,"The video appeared genuine, of a real person, who was answering questions from viewers. 
His answers were very disturbing and made me very much dislike him, but I am sure that such people exist.  Why anyone would watch his videos is surprising!","I had heard of them, but imagined that they would be easily identified - however information in this study suggests that they can be quite realistic?"
f0b9889f-f124-43c1-894f-dd89209d48ff,7,I have no way knowing I am right for sure - only my 'gut instinct'.,Only ever seen in comedy videos though.
f20a137a-d579-4760-84fd-f209425e4fb6,7,The human features and speech appeared real.,I have heard of instances were it was used by criminals.
f2849e89-a397-4e02-a7cd-2a16af3cbde7,7,"I read the subtitles before he said the words so I saw him saying words, and I never got the impression that the voice wasn't coming from him.",I wasn't aware but now I know I might view the video differently and try to look for any signs of it.
f2def64c-122d-4ea8-8c94-7db8ebb828f9,7,"His face seemed quite expressionless and his tone never really changed, plus some of his answers seemed a little unnatural to me.","It is not a hard concept to imagine, but I didn't know of their existence."
f49f93d5-0305-4cd7-b166-ede8f8f2c26c,7,"This video seemed genuine, however I thought Chris was reading from a script
I could tell this was not a real YouTuber based on his presentation
I figured it was faked in terms of he is pretending that he has subscribers who are interested in his life
The questions he was answering were too vague to be real","I'm aware that deepfakes exist. 
I've seen the Joe Rogan / Jordan Peterson / Kim Jong Un deepfakes

I don't think this study is truly testing deepfakes if you're simply splicing audio from one video and overlaying it on another
I think the subject is just reading a script

I could be wrong though :D
"
f4a33457-0dfc-4e30-985a-9e5c573fdf83,7,The answers seemed generic and lacked empathy especially when Chris talked about spending his weekends with his Grandmother,I've heard of Deepfake videos but not an expert on the subject.
f50a266e-a63a-45c4-9801-7ddfcc1cd40c,7,"I don't think a real person - who wanted to get more youtube viewers - would say they cheated on an exam and were happy about it, i don't think a real person would say they were spending time with their grannie so that she left them her house when she died and they would rarely admit to not giving up their seat for a heavily pregnant lady - however i certainly couldn't tell that he wasn't a deep fake from looking at him.",I have seen a documentary about it - it showed someone famous saying things they would never say in real life.
f6cd6302-a6d9-4a9f-8f12-9964dc119640,7,I believe Chris said those words as I saw them come out of his mouth.,"No, I did not know that videos could be manipulated in this way."
f70183da-027b-45a5-ab00-aa0e305699ba,7,I didn't notice any distortion and the facial gestures and mouth movements looked extremely natural,I'd seen examples of this before such as those of Trump.
f7d307ab-a894-4c7f-b8e1-3d7cc0bdc508,7,Facial expressions seemed life like and true to emotions.,I have seen computer CGI videos.
f7e03fd7-1ca0-47de-a681-221c5e174fd9,7,"I have seen several deepfake videos and this did not appear to be one, it's appeared too natural.","Yes, I have seen a number of deepfake videos on youtube."
f8388826-1a6c-4787-b700-840c4e4c9283,7,"Now this is mentioned, I thought there was a disconnect between Chris' physical reactions and what he said and when he said it",I saw that videos could be faked on a programme produced by BBC2 and presented by Ian hislop.  I didn't think of this whilst watching the video
fa5b5f53-445a-40aa-80eb-8174526a7e17,7,"The video seemed genuine to me, it looked like it was really Chris answering questions about himself. And his responses to the questions seem to flow naturally.",I don't think It was deepfakes as he seemed to have responded without any hesitation to all the questions.
fa6ea539-5fc8-4a2f-a33b-29a717e732e3,7,He did not seem genuine and showed no emotion,Did not know what this meant or was
fbbda005-88e1-4afa-b7f5-a266ca38cc3c,7,"For me the sentence that seemed odd was when Chris talked about spending time with his Grandma before she passes.  I don't think this is what a person would say, it would be implied and most people listening would know that this is why he is spending time with her but it wouldn't be so blatantly stated.",Was not aware although there have been some videos of Donald Trump that i wish were Deepfaked but unfortunately they are probably real.
fd3df7cf-4821-47f5-b2cf-27fef255091f,7,Some of the things that Chris mentioned in the video were very insensitive and its hard to believe that someone would actually mean to say those things,i didnt realise that videos could be faked in such a manner.
ffad50ca-d832-4914-81b2-c9398730a625,7,Chris felt very robotic in his answers. They weren't expressed with a lot of adjectives or enthusiasm.,I was not aware of this term before.
