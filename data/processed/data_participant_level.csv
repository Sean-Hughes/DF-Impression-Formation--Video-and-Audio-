He seemed like a genuine and honest person who did some shitty things. I judged him for what he did but also how he was communicating in that video. That's why I gave him a neutral score.

One, there were parts of the study where after doing a section, I would do the same section again. I feel that I might have had slower reaction time to the first question because the repeat sections didn't have the instructions clearly labeled (e.g. f chris, j bob). I'm not sure if this had a profound effect on the study, but just wanted to note it.

Second, on the short answer questions after the 'f' and 'j' key sections, the boxes were kind of awkward. When I typed my response, it would start in the middle of the box and wouldn't wrap around. Just a visual thing -- no effect or trouble answering the actual questions."

Example: On Nintendo Switch, the action key is the A key, (which is located on the right) and on the Playstation the action key often is the X key, which is located on the bottom. Because I use the PlayStation more often when I flip to the other console, I often push the bottom button rather than the side button and the intended action doesn't work (because muscle memory)

I think the researchers showed the video of Chris initially to induce positive feelings, familiarity associated with him.

The opposite is true for Bob and negative feelings/characteristics. Further, Chris looked like a friendly guy, whereas Bob was dressed in black and looked less trustworthy. Next, researchers asked participants to sort Chris into the same pile as the negative words and Bob with the positive. It was a more difficult task to do this as we had previously associated Bob and Chris with negative and positive words, respectively. I expect that researchers will be looking at reaction time and accuracy to determine whether there is a difference between each task. I expect that it is hypothesized that participants will be more accurate and RT will be shorter for the first task than the second task. Then I think it may have been expected that participants will still have positive feelings about Chris, despite more recently having to categorize him with the negative feelings, because probably once an initial decision has been made about something, it is more difficult to incorporate new conflicting information into one's already-established opinion.","It was a positive first impression.
