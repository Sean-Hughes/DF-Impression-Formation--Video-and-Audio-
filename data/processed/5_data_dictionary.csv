experiment;Experiment data was collected as part of
intervention_medium;What medium did the intervention (whether deepfaked or genuine) take (e.g., video and audio vs just audio)

IAT_D2;The IAT captures automatic evaluations of Chris, the character depicted in the intervention. Accuracies and reaction times on IAT were converted to D2 scores, following Greenwald et al 2003, and implemented using the IATScores R package. Briefly, D2 is a standardized difference score of trimmed reaction times in one block type versus the other: (mean_block_2 - mean_block_1) / standard_deviation_all_blocks

deepfake_detected;"Open ended responses to the deepfaking detection question were hand scored by two independent reviewers (see ""3 Instructions for raters.docx""). If both reviewers scored an open ended response as having detected the intervention as a deepfake (whether correctly or not), this variable was set to TRUE. Otherwise FALSE."
