He told a story from college where he helped a friend pass his exam. The friend would have failed if it were not for Chris' help. He's really glad he took the time to help out.
His current videos are slightly different to his previous videos as he has just moved into a new apartment and has had a haircut. He mentioned the new apartment in a previous video.
